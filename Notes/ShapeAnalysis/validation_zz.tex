To validate the procedures discussed in the previous section, detailed studies 
have been carried out using simulated events from the Spring11 CMSSW\_4\_1\_X production.
The basic object selections are taken from the Ref~\cite{FIXMET}-~\cite{FIXME}. 
We evaluate the effects on the expected limits projected to $\mathcal{L}~=~5~\pm~0.22~\ifb$. 
The data to simulation scale factors for the Top and \WW{} background are derived using 
a dataset corresponding to $\mathcal{L}~=~1.1~\pm~0.05~\ifb$. 
The Drell-Yan background are derived using the photon jet method based on 
$\mathcal{L}~=~1.1~\pm~0.05~\ifb$, which is then scaled to $5~\ifb$ assuming 
the same systematic uncertainty. In all the test, we run 10000 toymc to estimate the 
effects on the median expected cross-section ration limits and the 1/2-$\sigma$ 
uncertainty bands with a statistical precision about 0.01. 


\subsubsection{Shape vs. Counting Analyses}

As in the $\hww$ analysis, we compare the improvement in the performance using the shape analysis 
with respect to the simple cut-and-cut analysis, shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:mva_mtshapevscuts_hzz}-\ref{tab:mvashape_mevsbdt_hzz}. 

In the case of the $H\to ZZ$ analysis, using shape based on a single variation $m_T$ yield 
comparable performance comparing to using the shape based on BDT or Matrix Element method. 
The shape analysis based on the Matrix Element outputs brings additional $20\%$ improvement 
compared to the shape analysis based on $m_T$ for the low higgs mass hypothesis $mH=250\GeVcc$. 
Compared to the shape analysis based on $m_T$, the shape analysis based on the BDT outputs 
brings additional $25\%$ improvement in the intermediate higgs mass hypotheses 
$ 350<=~mH~<=~400\GeVcc$ and additional $15\%$ improvement in the higher mass hypotheses
$mH~>~400\GeVcc$. 

In the following validations, we use the $m_T$ based shape analysis as an example 
to demonstrate the effects due to the shape systematics.

\subsubsection{Inclusion of Shape Uncertainties}

In this section, we document the shape systematics effects to the median expected cross section 
ratio limits as a function of the Higgs mass, together with the 1/2-$\sigma$ uncertainty bands. 
The following systematic variations are considered,
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item {Statistic uncertainties in the template}
\item {QCD scale variations to the Higgs process}
\item {Top shape variations}
\item {WW shape variations}
\item {WZ shape variations}
\item {ZZ shape variations}.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The effects due to the lepton efficiency and scale variations are neglible and we assign 
the normalization uncertainties. 

Table~\ref{tab:mva_mtshapewithwithout_hzz} shows the effect on the results by including such uncertainties. 
Table~\ref{tab:mva_mtshapevscuts_withshapevar_hzz} compares the cut-based results and the one using 
shape analysis including all systematics due to shape variation. 
Overall we see on average 8-30\% gain in the performance. 
The improvements in the intermediate mass range between 300 and 500 $\GeVcc$ 
are larger, about $20-30\%$. 
To understand the effects of the individual source of the uncertainties, 
we also compare the results by adding each source progressively, shown in Table~\ref{tab:mva_mtshape_detail}.
