\subsection{Systematic uncertainties in shape analysis} 

There are two main types of systematic uncertainties specific to the
shape analysis that we use:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Statistical shape uncertainties} caused by small number of events available for the shape extraction
  \item {\bf Shape variation uncertainties} caused by various systematic effects that have an impact on the shape
\end{itemize}
