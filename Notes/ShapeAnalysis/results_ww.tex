For proper interpretation of p-values and signal significance
calculation it is important to take into account the ``look elsewhere
effect'' (LEE). Since we don't know the true Higgs mass we have a
number of trials to find an excess by looking at statistically
independent set of events at different mass points. That increases our
chance to find an excess by a trial factor that should be taken into
account. A rule of thumb to get a rough estimation of the trial factor
is to divide the size of the mass search window by the mass
resolution. For \WW\ in [110,200] GeV mass window with apparent mass
resolution of 30-40 GeV we have a trial factor of the order of 3. Such
a trial factor has a small impact on reported results in term of the
number of standard deviations, i.e. a $5\sigma$ effect without taking
into account LEE would become a $4.8\sigma$ effect with proper
treatment of LEE.
