We have recorded the supporting material for the
``reload'' of this analysis for the Lepton Photon 2011 conference.
This LP analysis comprises the addition of the post-EPS dataset
to this analysis, and a number of small technical changes.

The technical changes were confirmed to have no significant 
impact on the results in the EPS dataset.  
The data to simulation scale factors and background estimations
were derived for both the EPS and post-EPS datasets.
The results obtained in the post-EPS dataset were found to be
consistent with the results from the EPS analysis, thus
the two were combined to perform the reload.

The EPS counting analysis indicated an excess in the same flavor final state,
both in the 0-jet Higgs boson mass range ~150-170GeV region
and the 1-jet analysis over the full mass range.
This trend is not evident in the post-EPS dataset.

FIXME discussion of the limits when combining the 
EPS and post-EPS datasets and quote the exclusion limits FIXME

FIXME discussion of the effect of the MT cut FIXME

We conclude that adding the post-EPS dataset to this analysis 
supports the hypothesis that same flavor excesses in the EPS
analysis are more likely attributed to statistical fluctuation
than a systematic bias in Drell-Yan estimation.
Evidence has been presented that the robustness of the analysis 
can be improved by the addition of a cut to remove events
with an $M_T$ inconsistent with the signal hypothesis.
