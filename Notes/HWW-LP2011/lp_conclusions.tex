The H$\to$WW$\to2l2\nu$ analysis was successfully updated for the
Lepton Photon 2011 conference. The results obtained in the post-EPS
dataset were found to be consistent with the results from the EPS
analysis, thus the two were combined to perform the update.

The EPS counting analysis indicated an excess in the same flavor final
state, both in the 0-jet Higgs boson mass range ~150-170GeV region and
the 1-jet analysis over the full mass range.  This trend is not
evident in the post-EPS dataset.

We conclude that the addition of the post-EPS dataset 
supports the hypothesis that the same flavor excesses in the EPS
analysis are more likely to be a statistical fluctuation
than a systematic bias in Drell-Yan estimation.

Evidence has been presented that the robustness of the analysis can be
improved by the addition of a cut to remove events with an $M_T$
inconsistent with the signal hypothesis. We advocate to use this
selection requirement to reduce contribution of poorly understood
backgrounds to the analysis.

The Higgs exclusion limits extracted from the Lepton Photon
dataset are [140-200] GeV for the cut-based analysis and
[144-200] for the multivariate analysis.
