We find the post-EPS data to be consistent with the EPS data with regard to trigger and
lepton efficiencies. We find good agreement between data and MC for the distribution of the number
of reconstructed vertices per event after re-weighting based on the expected number of pile-up events.
We inspected the relevant kinematic variables (see Section \ref{app:lp_postEPSdist} for details) and find no significant
discrepancies between the two data samples.
