We used the tag and probe method to study the lepton selection
efficiencies in the EPS and post-EPS datasets.
The post-EPS dataset was initially available in the PromptReco V5 processing,
which is known to contain ECAL calibration issues leading to large fake MET.
These studies were performed on the PromptReco V5 before the data was 
reprocessed because the calibration issues are not expected to bias the
lepton efficiencies.

The electron and muon selections efficiencies in the two datasets
and compared in Tables \ref{tab:lp_eff_electrons} and \ref{tab:lp_eff_muons}
respectively.
Because we do not observe any significant change in the
lepton selection efficiencies, we perform the LP analysis
using the same data to simulation scale factors as the EPS analysis.

An independent measurement of the data to simulation scale factors found
