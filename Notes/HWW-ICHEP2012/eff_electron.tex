The electron selection efficiency can be factorised into two contributions,
the efficiency from the electron reconstruction and from the additional
analysis selections that are described in Section~\ref{sec:sel_electrons}.

The electron reconstruction efficiency is defined as the efficiency for a
supercluster to be matched to a reconstructed ECAL driven GSF electron.
The data to simulation scale factor was measured in 2011 by the Egamma POG binned in
$p_T$ and $\eta$~\cite{ref:egamma_eff_gsf}. This measurement is not yet
available in 2012 data, thus we assume the scale factor to be one with an 
uncertainty of 2\%, based on the previous studies.

The N-1 simulation-to-data scale factors for the offline selection
for the 2012A period
are tabulated in detail in Appendix \ref{app:appendix_efficiency_electron}.
