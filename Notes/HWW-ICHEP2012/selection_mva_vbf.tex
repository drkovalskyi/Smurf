For the VBF channel we performed a similar multivariate analysis as in the 0 and 1 jet bins. 
In this channel the main background is the top events. Therefore the discriminant is 
constructed to distinguish signal against the top background. 
In additional to the $\WW$ preselection we apply a loose cut on the 
$\mll$ and $\mt$ to enhance the signal to background ration. 
The selection on the $\mll$ is the same as in the 0 and 1 jet bins. 
For $\mt$ a loose window selection between 30 GeV and the higgs mass is used. 

The input variables used in the MVA analysis include the same ones 
in the 0-jet bin, adding the following three VBF jet related ones:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Delta\eta (j_1-j_2)$
\item $m_{j_1j_2}$ 
\item the leading jet $\eta$.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The full shape of the classifier output is used for the final analysis. Compared to the 
cut-based analysis this MVA based approach improves the search sensitivity by 
about 20-30\%. 

The systematic uncertainties related to the dilepton variables can be 
addressed in the same way as in the 0 and 1 jet bins. However we need to 
do a careful study for the additional jet related variables. 
For the main top background this can be validated by comparing the 
top enriched sample from data and MC. 
{\bf However for other backgrounds such as the $\WW$ we need to do a more careful 
study to convince ourselves that the shapes from the MC is reasonable. }
