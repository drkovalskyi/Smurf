A valid question is the effect on the limits on each Higgs mass hypothesis in
the case of the presence of a Higgs signal at a given mass. As a test, we
consider a Higgs with $\mHi = 125~\GeV$, and see the effect on the limits, both
cut-based and BDT-based analyses. The expected and observed upper 
limits are reported in Tables~\ref{tab:cutbased_mh125_nj} 
and~\ref{tab:bdtbased_mh125_nj}, and 
in Figure~\ref{fig:uls_mh125_nj}. The observed upper limits in this context are 
the mean average limits in the presence of background plus signal.
