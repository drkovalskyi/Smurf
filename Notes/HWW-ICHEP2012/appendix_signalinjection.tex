A valid question is the effect on the limits on each Higgs mass hypothesis in
the case of the presence of a Higgs signal at a given mass. As a test, we
consider a Higgs with $\mHi = 125~\GeV$, and see the effect on the limits, both
cut-based and BDT-based analyses. The expected and observed upper 
limits are reported in Tables~\ref{tab:cutbased_mh125_nj} 
and~\ref{tab:bdtbased_mh125_nj}, and in Figure~\ref{fig:uls_mh125_nj}. 
The observed upper limits in this context are the mean average limits in the presence of background plus signal.

The excess due to the presence of a $\mHi = 125~\GeV$ Higgs is expected to be large in a broad range up to about $\mHi = 160~\GeV$ analysis.
At this mass, both \W\ are on-shell: the kinematic distributions of the Higgs signal change significantly and the shape of the BDT output is clearly 
different (Fig.~\ref{fig:bdt_mh125}).
