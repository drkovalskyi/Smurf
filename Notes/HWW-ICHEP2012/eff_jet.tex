We apply a data-driven method to estimate the $H \to \WW$ jet counting 
efficiency and its systematic uncertainties in data. 
In this method, the $H \to \WW$ jet counting efficiency in data $\epsilon_{H \to \WW}$
is estimated to be the value obtained from simulation multiplied by a data to simulation
scale factor from \dyll~events such that,

$$\epsilon_{H \to \WW} = \epsilon_{\Z}^{data} (\frac{\epsilon_{H \to \WW}}{\epsilon_{\Z}})^{MC}.$$

The uncertainty in $\epsilon_{H \to \WW}$ can be factorized into the 
$\Z$ efficiency uncertainty in data and the $H \to \WW/\Z$ efficiency ratio 
uncertainty in simulation. 
The former is dominated by the statistical uncertainty, while 
theoretical uncertainties due to higher order corrections contribute most 
to the $H \to \WW/\Z$ efficiency ratio uncertainties. The data to simulation 
correction factor is close to unity for all jet bins
