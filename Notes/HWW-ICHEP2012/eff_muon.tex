The muon selection efficiency and the resulting data to simulation
scale factors are estimated using a similar method to the electron efficiency. 
In the 2011 analysis we measured the efficiency for 
reconstructing a global muon or a tracker muon with respect
to a track was measured to be consistent with $100\%$ for the Run2011A period, 
while it is roughly $99\%$ in the region of the detector covered by the 
CSC muon detectors in the Run2011B period. These measurements are not yet available
in 2012 data, thus we assume a scale factor of one with an appropriate systematic
uncertainty.

The N-1 simulation-to-data scale factors for the offline muon selection
are tabulated in detail in Appendix \ref{app:appendix_efficiency_muon}.
