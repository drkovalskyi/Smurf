The muon selection efficiency and the resulting data to simulation
scale factors are estimated using a similar method to the electron efficiency. 
The efficiency for reconstructing a global muon or a tracker muon with respect
to a track is measured to be consistent with $100\%$ for the Run2011A period, 
while it is roughly $99\%$ in the region of the detector covered by the 
CSC muon detectors in the Run2011B period, summarized in Table 
\ref{tab:eff_mu_reco_Run2011B}.

We measure the offline muon selection efficiency with respect to a reconstructed 
global muon or tracker muon denominator. The muon selection efficiency measurement 
results are tabulated in detail in Appendix 
\ref{app:efficiency_studies_muon}. The Monte Carlo to data scale factors for the 
muon selection efficiency are on average around $0.97$ for $p_{T}$ below $20$ 
\GeV\ and $0.99$ for $p_{T}$ above $20$ \GeV.  
Analogous to electrons, there is a decrease in signal muon efficiency of $7-8\%$ from the
Run2011A period to the Run2011B period for muons with 
$p_{T}$ below $20$ \GeV, and a corresponding but smaller decrease in the 
Monte Carlo to data scale factor.
