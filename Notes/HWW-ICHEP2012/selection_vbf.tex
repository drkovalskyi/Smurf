The cross section for Higgs boson production in the vector boson fusion (VBF)
mode is roughly ten times smaller than the gluon-gluon fusion mode.
However, the VBF signal can be extracted
using simple selections, especially in the fully leptonic decay channel
where the backgrounds are expected to be relatively low.

The $\hww$ events from VBF production is characterized by a pair of energetic 
forward-backward jets and very little hadronic activity in the rest of the event. 
As a starting point, we select the events that pass the $\ww$ preselection 
requiring two reconstructed jets with $\pt~>~30~\GeVc$ and no other jets between 
them with $\pt~>~30~\GeVc$. To reject the main background from top decays we 
apply further selections on the two jets $j_1$ and $j_2$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item neither of the jets must be $b$-tagged;
  \item $\Delta\eta (j_1-j_2) > 3.5$;
  \item $m_{j_1j_2} > 450\:\GeVcc$;
  \item $30~\GeVc < m_{T}^{\ell\ell\met} < m_H~\GeVcc$.
\end{itemize}
To improve the selection efficiency for the low mass Higgs signal we select 
events with $\mll~<~100~\GeVcc$. Events with same and opposite flavor final states 
are separated in order to obtain better sensitivity in the final limit.   
The $qqH$ contribution to the total  $\hww$ signal is found to be about 85\%
after full event selections for all the mass hypotheses considered.
