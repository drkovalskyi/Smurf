A search for the Higgs boson in the $W^+W^- \to 2\ell2\nu$ final state 
with $\intlumiEightTeV$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt s = 8~\TeV$ 
has been described. We search for Higgs candidate events in $ee$, 
$\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$ channels with 0, 1 and 2 or 3 reconstructed jets. 
In the 0 and 1 Jet bin final states, we combined the shape based approach in 
the different flavor channel and the cut based approach in the same 
flavor channel. 
The expected exclusion region at 95\% confidence levels is expected to 
be around [X-X] GeV. 
With the dataset corresponding to $\intlumiEightTeV$, we observe a 
broad excess in the low mass region of the search with 
the Higgs mass less than about 200 GeV, leading to a weaker exclusion 
region in the low mass region. 
The observed exclusion region is [X-X]. 

We also measure the corresponding $\WW$ cross-section.
The most precise measurement using events with zero reconstructed jets
is \wwCrossSectionMeasurement.
