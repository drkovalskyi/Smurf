A search for the Higgs boson in the $W^+W^- \to 2\ell2\nu$ final state 
with $\intlumiEightTeV$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt s = 8~\TeV$ 
has been described. We search for Higgs candidate events in $ee$, 
$\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$ channels with 0, 1 and 2 or 3 reconstructed jets. 
We also measure the corresponding $\WW$ cross-section. It should 
be emphasized that since some simulated samples are missing, 
the results are just preliminary and should be considered 
as placeholders.
