To reduce the background from diboson processes, we veto events
containing an additional lepton meeting the previously described
selection requirements with $\pt > 10~\GeVc$.  This removes $\sim
60\%$ of the $WZ$ component and $\sim 10\%$ of the $ZZ$ one.  The \ZZ\
component is dominated by $\ZZ \to 2l2\nu$ decays. The efficiency for
$WW \to 2l2\nu$ events is $\sim 99.9\%$.  Finally, in the events 
containing 2 or more jets, the angle in the transverse plane between 
the dilepton system and the system of two most energetic jets with 
$\pt^{jet}~>~15~\GeV$ must be smaller than $165$ degrees in
the $ee/\mu\mu$ final states. This requirement rejects $\dyll$
events, where the $\Z$ boson recoil against jets.
In the events with 0 or 1 jets, this variable is used as an input 
to the MVA-based Drell-Yan suppression technique..
