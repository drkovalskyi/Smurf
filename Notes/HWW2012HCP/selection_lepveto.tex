To reduce the background from diboson processes, we veto events
containing an additional lepton meeting the previously described
selection requirements with $\pt > 10~\GeV$.  This removes $\sim
60\%$ of the $WZ$ component and $\sim 10\%$ of the $ZZ$ one.  The \ZZ\
component is dominated by $\ZZ \to 2l2\nu$ decays. The efficiency for
$WW \to 2l2\nu$ events is $\sim 99.9\%$.
