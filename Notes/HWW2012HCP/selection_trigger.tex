Triggering on Higgs boson decays in the dilepton final state increases 
in difficulty with increasing instantaenous luminosity.
Single lepton triggers can only be sustained with very tight identification and
isolation requirements and large transverse momentum thresholds.
This means that double lepton triggers are the only viable option to maintain
sensitivity to a low mass Higgs boson, where the leptons transverse momentum
can be small.

We designed a suite of signal and control triggers appropriate for this analysis.
These dilepton triggers have a high efficiency to collect Higgs boson events
and are sufficiently loose to collect control events to estimate
fake lepton backgrounds and selection efficiencies with adequate precision.
The features and motivations for the analysis triggers and additional triggers to collect control events 
are described in detail in Reference~\cite{HWWICHEP2012}.
