To further reduce the Drell--Yan background, in the $\Ep\Em$ and
$\Mp\Mm$ final states we apply a few additional cuts.

First, to avoid the peaking component of \dyll, we veto events with a dilepton invariant mass within $15~\GeV$ of the $\Z$.  
Then, depending on the jet bin and the Higgs mass hypothesis, different approaches are exploited.

In the 0 and 1 jet final states, a MVA-based Drell-Yan suppression techique~\cite{dymva} (DY MVA) is used; 
DY MVA combines information from variables related to missing energy, kinematic and topological variables
maximising the signal-to-background ratio. A new training has been performed~\cite{newdymva}, 
using as signal sample a mixture of low mass and high mass Higgs events; in this way, DY MVA performance is optimal for all Higgs mass hypotheses. 

%For the high Higgs mass and $\WW$ analyses containing less than two jets, the signal has larger \met\ and
%the \dyll\ background is less important; therefore, a multivariate approach does not improve the performance and 
%min-MET is used as a discrimiating variable. 
%In addition, in order to reject events where the $\Z$ boson recoils against jets, the angle in 
%the transverse plane between the dilepton system and the most energetic jet with $\pt^{jet}~>~15~\GeV$ 
%must be smaller than $165$ degrees.

In events with two or more jets, pileup effects are not dominant since fake \met\ in \dyll\ is mainly due to the mismeasurement of 
the hadronic recoil; therefore, the use of track-MET degradres the performance and plain pf-MET is used. 
In this case, the hadronic recoil is clustered into two jets; thus, the system of the two most energetic jets is considered when cutting 
on the azimuthal angle difference from the dilepton momentum.

The selection requirements are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:metsel}.
