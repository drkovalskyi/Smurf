In this section we document the main shape variations we include in the 
2D ($m_{ll}, m_T$) analysis performed in the low mass analysis of the 0-Jet bin. 
For the convenience we plot the variations on the signal region of the 
125 GeV signal hypothesis with $m_{ll}<80$ GeV and $m_T<130$ GeV. 
Figure~\ref{fig:qqww_shapevar_theory}-\ref{fig:top_shapevar_theory} 
show the shape systematics for the main backgrounds $qq\to WW$, $W$+Jets and Top. 
Figure~\ref{fig:qqww_shapevar_instr} show the shape systematics due to the 
intrumental uncertainties in the physics objects reconstruction using 
$qq\to WW$ process as an example. Note that we include all the instrumental 
uncertainties induced shape systematics for all processes where the central shapes 
are taken from simulation. More detailed description can be found in Reference~\cite{MVASyst}.
