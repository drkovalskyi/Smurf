The standard model (SM) of particle physics successfully describes the
majority of high-energy experimental data~\cite{pdg}. One of the key
remaining questions is the origin of the masses of $\W$~and
$\Z$~bosons.  In the SM in its simplest implementation it is
attributed to the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry caused
by a new scalar field~\cite{Higgs1, Higgs2, Higgs3}. The existence of
the associated field quantum, the Higgs boson, has yet to be
experimentally confirmed.

The $\Hi\to\WW$ channel is particularly sensitive for Higgs boson
searches in the intermediate mass range
($120-200~\GeV$)~\cite{dittmar}. This document describes the search
for the Higgs boson in the $\Hi\To\WW \To \Lep\Lprime\Nu\Nubar$
channel, for Higgs boson masses in the range of $110-600~\GeV$ using the 
2012 dataset available by HCP2012 conferences. 
    
The study is based on the analysis prepared for the ICHEP2012 conferences
~\cite{HWWICHEP2012}. Several modifications and improvements have
been added mainly to extend the search sensitivity. 
%both to cope with the more difficult conditions due to the
%higher pileup in 2012, and also to extend the sensitivity.

The main analysis strategy is to select events with two opposite
charged leptons, large missing energy and little jet activity. The two
leptons are required to be isolated electrons or muons with $\pt$ 
greater than 10~\GeV{}.

Here is a list of important changes with respect to the 2011 analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\fixme MET corrections
\item
\fixme New trained DYMVA in \ee\ and \mm\ final states;
\item 
Significantly improved 2-jet VBF analysis;
\end{itemize}
Throughout the analysis, ``2-jet" means 2 or 3 jets with additional 
requirements which are described in Sec.~\ref{sec:sel_jets}.
