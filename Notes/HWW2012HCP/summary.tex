A search for the Higgs boson in the $W^+W^- \to 2\ell2\nu$ final state 
with $\intlumiEightTeV$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt s = 8~\TeV$ 
has been described. We search for Higgs candidate events in $ee$, 
$\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$ channels with 0, 1 and 2 or 3 reconstructed jets. 
In the 0 and 1 Jet bin final states, we combined the shape based approach in 
the different flavor channel and the cut based approach in the same 
flavor channel. The expected exclusion region at 95\% C.L. for the SM Higgs boson 
The observed exclusion region at 95\% C.L. for the SM Higgs boson 
is around [129-531] GeV.

Combing the $\intlumiSevenTeV$ data at 7 TeV, we expect to 
exclude the SM Higgs boson with the mass range of [118-550] GeV at 95\% C.L.
The expected uppler limit is about 0.5 times the SM expectation for $m_\text{H}=125$ GeV.  
The observed exclusion region at 95\% C.L. for the SM Higgs boson is around [128-600] GeV. 
The expected(observed) significance at \mHi=125~\GeV~is $4.1\sigma(3.1\sigma)$.
