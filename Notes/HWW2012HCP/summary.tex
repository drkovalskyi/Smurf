A search for the Higgs boson in the $W^+W^- \to 2\ell2\nu$ final state 
with $\intlumiEightTeV$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt s = 8~\TeV$ 
has been described. We search for Higgs candidate events in $ee$, 
$\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$ channels with 0, 1 and 2 or 3 reconstructed jets. 
In the 0 and 1 Jet bin final states, we combined the shape based approach in 
the different flavor channel and the cut based approach in the same 
flavor channel. 
The expected exclusion region at 95\% C.L. for the SM Higgs boson 
is around [126-421] GeV, while the observed exclusion region is 
[137-211] and [290-488] GeV. 
A small excess of events is observed for hypothetical low
Higgs boson masses which makes the observed limits weaker 
than the expected ones under the null hypothesis.

Combing the $\intlumiSevenTeV$ data at 7 TeV, we expect to 
exclude the SM Higgs boson with the mass range of [122-476] GeV at 95\% C.L., 
while the observed exclusion range is [131-529] GeV. 
The observed(expected) uppler imits are about 1.5(0.8) times the 
SM expectation for $m_\text{H}=125$ GeV.
