We have performed a measurement of the $W^+W^-$ production cross-section
using an integrated luminosity of $\intlumi$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s} = $
7~$\TeV$. The measurement was performed in the \wwlnln{} final state.
The $W^+W^-$ production cross-section was measured to be:

\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{WW}  = 50.95 \pm 1.93~\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 4.45~\mathrm{(syst.)} \pm 1.12~\mathrm{(lumi.)~pb},
\end{equation*}

to be compared with the standard model prediction \cite{Campbell:2011bn}:

\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{WW}  = 47 \pm 2 ~\mathrm{pb}.
\end{equation*}
