We have taken into account the following systematic uncertainties:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Luminosity:} We assume an uncertainty of 4.5\% since at this moment there are some
concerns about the actual luminosity measurements at CMS.

\item {\it Lepton identification and trigger efficiencies:}
We measure the efficiencies in data using the tag and probe method that is described
in detail in Section~\ref{sec:efficiency}.
The estimated uncertainty is about $2\%$ per lepton leg.

\item {\it Momentum scale:}
Due to several factors, the energy scale for electrons and the momentum
scale for muons have relatively large uncertainties in the current data
processing.
We assign a systematic uncertainty by varying the transverse momentum of the muons by $1\%$,
and $2\%$ and $5\%$ for electrons in the barrel and the endcap, respectively.
The contribution to the uncertainty on the dilepton efficiency is about $1.5\%$.

\item {\it $\met$ modeling:} We use a data-driven method to estimate the $\dyll$
background, which is affected by the $\met$ resolution.
Events with neutrinos giving real $\met$ in the final state also have a small uncertainty.
We assess this uncertainty on the event selection efficiency by varying the $\met$ in signal events
by an additional $10\%$. We find an uncertainty on the event selection efficiency of around 2\%.

\item {\it Background estimation:}
The methods to estimate the different backgrounds are explained in
Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}.
Here we summarize the systematic uncertainties associated with the methods used.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Jet induced backgrounds, $\Wjets$ and $QCD$: the associated systematic
    uncertainty is 36\%.
  \item Top background: this background is estimated using $b$-tagged events and
    the $b$-tagging efficiency, which is measured in control regions in data.
    The associated systematic uncertainties are below $5\%$,
    while the statistical component is about $25\%$ for $\intlumi$.
  \item Drell-Yan background: The uncertainty arises from the limited knowledge of
    events with large $\met$ tails.
    We conservatively quantify such uncertainty from the variation of the ratio $R_{out/in}$
    (Eq.\ref{eq:dyest}) as a function of the $\met$ requirement,
    leading to an estimate of about $125\%$.
    As very few $\dyll$ events are selected, this has anyhow a small affect on the final analysis results ($\sim xxx\%$).
  \item Other backgrounds: The sub-dominant backgrounds are estimated from simulation
    with appropriate systematic uncertainties on their cross section.
    We take $3\%$ for $\WZ$ and $\ZZ$ events and $10\%$ for $W+\gamma$ events.
    These uncertainties must be augmented by the luminosity normalization uncertainty.
  \end{itemize}

\item {\it Pileup:} an incorrect modeling of the pileup in the Monte Carlo samples
can bias the expected event yields. The simulated events have been re-weighted
on the basis of the number of reconstructed
primary vertices. The re-weighting procedure affects only slightly the results of the analysis,
the event yields changing by $\sim1\%$. The latter is conservatively assumed as
the corresponding systematic uncertainty.

\item {\it Jet veto efficiency:}
FIXME - update references in jet veto section.
This is dominated by the theoretical uncertainty, and is found to be 5.4\%.

\item {\it Theoretical uncertainties:}
FIXME - need to evaluate the PDF uncertainty on the WW signal acceptance

\item {\it Monte Carlo statistics:} We also take into account the
size of the simulated event samples. 
\end{itemize}
