The fully leptonic final state consists of two isolated leptons
and large missing energy from the two undetectable neutrinos.
The major reducible background processes are \ttbar{}, \wjets{} and Drell-Yan. 
We thus perform several steps to select and extract the $\WW$ signal from data:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We select events that pass pre-defined lepton triggers.
    \item We then select those events with two oppositely charged 
    high $\pt$ isolated leptons ($ee$, $\mu\mu$, $e\mu$) requiring:
        \begin{itemize}    
            \item $\pt>20~\GeVc$ for both leptons;
            \item standard identification and isolation requirements 
	    on both leptons.
        \end{itemize}
     \item We reject events with more than zero reconstructed jets;
     \item large transverse missing energy due to the neutrinos.
\end{enumerate}

The selection steps are now described in detail below.
