We apply a data-driven method to estimate the jet veto 
efficiency and its systematic uncertainties in data. 
In this method, the jet veto efficiency on $\WW$ events in data $\epsilon_{\WW}$
is estimated to be the value obtained from simulation multiplied by a data to simulation
scale factor from \dyll~events such that,

$$\epsilon_{H \to \WW} = \epsilon_{\Z}^{data} (\frac{\epsilon_{\WW}}{\epsilon_{\Z}})^{MC}.$$

The uncertainty in $\epsilon_{\WW}$ can be factorized into the 
$\Z$ efficiency uncertainty in data and the $H \to \WW/\Z$ efficiency ratio 
uncertainty in simulation. 
The former is dominated by the statistical uncertainty, while 
theoretical uncertainties due to higher order corrections contribute most 
to the $\WW/\Z$ efficiency ratio uncertainties. 

FIXME - summarise results here

%The data to simulation correction factor is close to unity for the zero-jet and 1-jet bins, 
%while we observe some disagreement for events with at least two reconstructd jets. 
%This is not surprising since Powheg is an NLO generator, and 
%only expected to produce an accurate description for events 
%containing up to one jet. For instance, the comparison between data and Madgraph 
%simulation, which accounts for leading order diagrams containing up to four additional
%partons, gives much better agreement in the 2-jet bin.
