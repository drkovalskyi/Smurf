The top quark induced background in the \WW\ analysis originates from
\ttbar\ and the single top (\tw) processes, the latter being especially imporatant 
in the 0-Jet bin.  A consistent theoretical description of the two
processes at high perturbation orders is not straightforward to attain
as already at NLO some \tw\ diagrams coincides with LO \ttbar\
ones \cite{singleTopInterference}.  The Monte Carlo simulated samples
used in the analysis exploit an approach recently
proposed \cite{singleTopRemoval}, which addresses the overlap by
discarding the common diagrams from the \tw\ process either at
amplitude level ({\it Diagram Removal}) or at cross section level
({\it Diagram Subtraction}).  The former is considered the default
scheme, whereas the latter is used as cross check.

The procedure to estimate the top background from data in the case of
the 0-Jet bin established in \cite{HWW2011} has been adapted to the
new theoretical description of \ttbar\ and \tw{}. Before assessing the
adjustments to the procedure, it is worth reviewing the key points of
the normalization strategy.

Rejection for the top background is achieved by top-tagged events,
i.e. events with a b-tagged jet or a soft muon as defined in
Section~\ref{sec:sel_toptag}.  The estimation of this background
relies on the measurement on data of the top-tagging efficiency.  The
procedure deployed in \cite{HWW2011} in the case of the 0-Jet bin
proceeds accordingly to the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
A top enriched region is defined requiring exactly one b-tagged jet
with \pt larger than $30$ GeV (denominator).  Those events among this
sample with at least one b-tagged jets with
$10<\ensuremath{p_\mathrm{T}}<30$ GeV or one soft muon defines the
numerator. The ratio of the yields in the numerator and denominator
properly corrected from other backgrounds contamination provides the
top-tagging efficiency for one ``top-taggable'' leg,
$\epsilon_{1leg}^{data}$.
\item 
The actual top-tagging efficiency, $\epsilon_{topTag}^{data}$, is
computed accounting for the \ttbar fraction of the top background
($f_{t\bar{t}}^{MC}$) accordingly to the formula:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:oldTopTagEff}
\epsilon_{topTag}^{data} = f_{t\bar{t}}^{MC}(1-(1-\epsilon_{1leg}^{data})^2) + (1-f_{t\bar{t}}^{MC})\epsilon_{1leg}^{data}
\end{equation} 
where the first term on the right accounts for \ttbar\ (two taggable
legs) and the second term for \tw\ (one taggable leg). The value
$f_{t\bar{t}}^{MC}$ is determined from Monte Carlo in the 0-Jet bin at
the \WW\ preselection level, removing the anti top-tagging.
\item 
A dedicated control region is defined in the 0-Jet bin by requiring
top-tagged events.  The data yields in this region corrected for the
other backgrounds contaminations are then used together with
top-tagging efficiency to predict the top background after \WW\
preselections level:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:topExtrapolation}
N^{top}_{WW region}=N_{topTag}^{top}\frac{1-\epsilon_{topTag}^{data}}{\epsilon_{topTag}^{data}} = 
(N_{topTag}^{data}-N_{other-bkg}^{data})\frac{1-\epsilon_{topTag}^{data}}{\epsilon_{topTag}^{data}}
\end{equation} 
\end{enumerate} 

In a nutshell, the new procedure refines the way the top-tagging
efficiency is extracted from data, taking properly into account the
different features of \ttbar\ and \tw{}.
\begin{itemize}

\item 
The top-tagging efficiency for one leg, $\epsilon_{1leg}^{data}$, is
computed for \ttbar\ only, that is both non-top backgrounds and \tw\
yields are subtracted from the measured data in the 1-Jet bin control
region defined above (both numerator and deniminator).  The yields
for \tw\ are estimated from the Monte Carlo normalized accordingly to
the data-driven predictions in the 1-Jet bin previously evaluated.

\item 
The overall top-tagging efficiency, $\epsilon_{topTag}^{data}$, is
then redefined to account for the fraction of \tw\ events that looks
like \ttbar\ ($x$), that is with two top-taggable legs.
Equation \ref{eq:oldTopTagEff} thus becomes:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:newTopTagEff}
\epsilon_{topTag}^{data} = (f_{t\bar{t}}^{MC} + x(1-f_{t\bar{t}}^{MC}) )(1-(1-\epsilon_{1leg}^{data})^2) + (1-f_{t\bar{t}}^{MC})(1-x)\epsilon_{1leg}^{data}
\end{equation} 
The fraction $x$ matches the value of $\epsilon_{1leg}$ estimated from
the \tw\ Monte Carlo.  We consider this a good approximation as
$\epsilon_{1leg}$ is the fraction of events with one b-tagged jet
with \pt larger than 30 GeV (the first ``top-taggable'' leg) and
top-tagged leg (a b-tagged jets below 30 GeV or a soft muon).

\end{itemize}

The extrapolation from the top background control region in the 0-Jet
bin to the signal \WW\ region is still performed accordingly to
Equation \ref{eq:topExtrapolation}, where $\epsilon_{topTag}^{data}$
is now defined by Eq. \ref{eq:newTopTagEff}.

The plots in Figure \ref{fig:jetLowBtag} show the distribution of the
b-tag discrimiator for the jet with $\pt$ lower than 30 GeV and the
highest b-tag discriminator in the denominator and numerator of the
control region.
