This note documents the $W^+W^-$ production cross-section
measurement in $\intlumi$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s} = $
7~$\TeV$ using leptonic decays, i.e. \wwlnln{}, with electrons
and muons in the final state. Fully leptonic tau decays are also
considered as a part of the signal, but the selection requirements are
not optimized for such events.  The work is based on the selections
and background estimation methods used in the Higgs boson search
in the $\WW$ channel described in Ref.~\cite{HWW2011Final}.
