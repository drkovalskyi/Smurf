A new approach for the same flavor \hww\ analysis based on a MVA selection trained against Drell-Yan background has been developed and tested on 2011 data sample.
After all selections, there is a signal increase of $\sim$60\% with the same Drell-Yan contamination as in the 2011 analysis. 
The consequent increased sensitivity is 2-9\% (\mHi$\leq$140 \GeVcc) combining opposite and same flavor final states in the 0- and 1-jet bins.
