A search for the SM Higgs boson decaying to $\WW$ in pp
collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7+8~\TeV$ is performed by the CMS 
experiment using a data sample corresponding to an integrated 
luminosity of 24.4 $\ifb$. For a SM Higgs boson mass of 125 
$\GeV$, the significance of the excess with respect to the 
background only hypothesis is 4.1 standard deviations, 
while 5.1 standard deviations are expected assuming the SM 
prediction. The observed signal strength for such Higgs mass 
is 0.77 $\pm$ 0.21, consistent with the SM prediction. No other 
significant deviations are observed, and therefore upper 
limits on the Higgs boson production relative to the standard 
model Higgs expectation are derived. A summary of the main 
analysis results for $\mHi = 125~\GeV$ is shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:main_results}.
