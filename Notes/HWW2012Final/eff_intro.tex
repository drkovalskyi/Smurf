 
We used the tag and probe method on \dyll~events to provide an unbiased, high-purity, 
lepton sample with which to measure both online and offline selection efficiencies.
The details of the method used are the same as the HCP analysis described
in Ref. \cite{hcp2012Note}, so we only report the results from 
applying the method to the full dataset in what follows.
