\wjets\ background remains to be one of the most complex backgrounds to estimate
with a sizable systematic uncertainty of 36\%. It helps to see what we
can learn from Monte Carlo about fakes, keeping in mind that it can be
wrong especially in regards to the absolute fake rate estimations.

The size of the \wjets\ Monte Carlo sample represents roughly 7~\ifb\
of equivalent luminosity. To use the sample most efficiently we rely
on Monte Carlo matching of reco level electrons and muons to the
corresponding lepton from the W decay. To identify origin of the
fakes, they are matched to objects in the hard-scatter part of Monte
Carlo generation information ignoring showering
details. Table~\ref{tab:appendix_mcFakes_raw} shows the raw
information about fake composition and origin in Monte Carlo. Based on
this information we derive fake rates for each fake type in
Table~\ref{tab:appendix_mcFakes_fakerates}. 

From the tables one can conclude that opposite sign and same sign
fakes have essentially identical fake rates and therefore same-sign
control samples can be used as valuable source of information of how
well we can estimate fakes in the opposite sign events. 

We have one more control sample to study fakes (mostly low \pt{}) -
Z+fake. Looking at Monte Carlo samples we find the fake rate to be
$0.108\pm0.014$ for muons and $0.053\pm0.018$ for electrons. These
results indicate that Z+fake control sample can be used to estimate
fake rates for \wjets\ opposite-sign dilepton events.
