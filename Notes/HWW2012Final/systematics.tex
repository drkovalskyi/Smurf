There have been improvements in systematics for 2D analysis.

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Shape systematics on WW PDF(Parton Density Function) in 2D analysis}  \\
        The method is discribed in \cite{AcceptUncert}. We take an envelop of different 
        PDF sets(NNPDF2.0, CT10(CTEQ), and MSTW2008) and measure variation with respect 
        to the default PDF set(LO CTEQ6L1 PDF) used in MC generation. The variation is 
        almost flat on the 2D plane with size less than 5\%. The impact of changing from 
        normalization uncertainty to shape systematics on PDF is less than 1\% to the 
        expected significance.

    \item \textbf{Uncontrained WW normalization in the fit using flat pdf}  \\   
        In the 2D analysis, there is a large sideband at high \mt and high \mll 
        dominated by WW. Fit is able to constrain the normalization of WW using this region. 
        So, we let the normalization of WW float using one nuisance parameter using flat pdf. 
        In order to avoid possible divergence issues in the fit, we set the range 
        of the nuisance as $\pm$100~\%. 

\end{itemize}
