moThe Higgs boson mass dependent signal selections are described in Section~\ref{sec:signal_selection}. 
In this section we summarise the results obtained all jet final states. 
Tables~\ref{tab:yield_mt_shapebased} shows the signal and 
equivalent data yields and background expectations in ee and $\mu\mu$ final states respectively. 
Figure~\ref{fig:histo_mt_250_5fb}-\ref{fig:histo_mt_600_5fb} show the $M_T$ distribution 
after the higgs mass dependent selections, for the mass hypothesis between 250 and 600 $\GeV$, 
corresponding to \intlumi. In these figures the background normalizations are scaled by 
each individual data-to-mc scale factors to account for the data and MC difference in 
background estimation described in section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}, 
lepton efficiency and the pileup reweighting. 

We consider the following uncertainties due to the shape variations, 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item {Statistic uncertainties in the template}
\item {QCD scale variations to the Higgs process}
\item {Top/WW shape variations}
\item {WZ shape variations}
\item {ZZ shape variations}.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The effects due to the lepton efficiency and scale variations are neglible and we assign only 
the normalization uncertainties. 
To understand the effects of the individual source of the uncertainties, 
we also compare the results by adding each source progressively, shown in Table~\ref{tab:mva_mtshape_detail}. 
Among all the shape systematics, the variations of the combined Top/WW shape is the leading effect. 
The details are documented in Ref.~\cite{shapeananote}. 

The expected cross section ratio limits as a function of the Higgs mass, together with the 1/2-$\sigma$ 
uncertainty bands are shown in Table~\ref{tab:limits_mtshape_5fb}. 
Table~\ref{tab:limits_mtshape_5fb} and Figure~\ref{fig:limits_5fb} show the 
observed and expected cross-section ratio limits. 
The observed exclusion region for the Standard Model Higgs is [275,455]~\GeV{} at 95\%C.L., 
compared to the expected exclusion region as [290,490]~\GeV{} at 95\%C.L.
Compared to the cut-based analysis, the shape analysis based on the $M_T$ variable improves the search sensitivity 
by upto $10\%$ considering all the shape variation systematics.
