The missing transverse energy is used to reject background events
where there is no natural source of missing energy, primarily Drell-Yan events. 

In the presence of high multiple-interactions (pile-up), the instrumental \met\ tail in 
$\dyll$ events increases significantly.  To improve the signal over background performance of \met\ selections 
in the presence of pile-up, we make use of the ``trk-MET''~\cite{trkMET}, constructed from 
charged particles consistent with originating from the primary vertex. 

The event $\met$ trk-MET is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\text{trk-MET} \equiv -\overrightarrow{p_T}(l_1) - \overrightarrow{p_T}(l_2) - \sum_i{\overrightarrow{p_T}(i)}, \\
\label{eq:trkmet}
\end{equation}

where $\overrightarrow{p_T}(l_1)$ and $\overrightarrow{p_T}(l_2)$ are the transverse momentum vectors of the two 
leptons passing the lepton selections described in Sec.~\ref{sec:sel_muons} and Sec.~\ref{sec:sel_electrons}, 
and $\overrightarrow{p_T}(i)$ represent the tranverse momentum vectors of the charged PFCandidates satisfying the following requirements:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item the track matched to PFCandidate has $\Delta z < 0.1$~cm with respect to the signal primary vertex;
\item the track has $\Delta R > 0.1$ with respect to both leptons, to avoid double-counting of the leptons.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


These two variations of \met\ are weakly-correlated in $\dyll$ background, and 
strongly correlated for the signal processes with geninue $\met$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:met_scatter}. 
Therefore the signal over background ratio is improved if we select the events 
based on the mininum of these two projected $\met$ values, $\text{min-MET} \equiv min(\text{trk-MET}, \text{PFMET})$.
