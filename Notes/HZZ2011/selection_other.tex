To reduce the background from $WZ$ and $ZZ$ processes, we veto events
containing an additional lepton satisfying the previously described selection requirements
with $\pt > 10~\GeVc$.

To reject the Drell-Yan background due to the jet energy mismeasurement in 
the recoiling jet, the angle between the dilepton system and the jet in 
the transverse plane must be smaller than 165 degrees. 
This selection is only applied if the jet $\pt>15\GeVc$. 
Figure~\ref{fig:dPhiDiLepJet1_dymc} shows the variable 
$\Delta\phi(\vec{p}_{\ell}, \text{leading jet})$ for Drell-Yan events in simulation.
