To reduce the background from $WZ$ and $ZZ$ processes, we veto events
containing an additional lepton satisfying the previously described selection requirements
with $\pt > 10~\GeVc$.

At the leading order $\dyll$ processes do not have $\met$. 
However the $\dyll$ process can contribute to the signal region
through fake $\met$, arising through either mis-measurement or
loss outside the geometric acceptance of the detector of a recoiling jet.
The latter effect was investigated using the MCFM program.
The probability to produce a high $p_{T}$ Z+$\met$  that would pass our selection
by the loss of a parton with sufficient $p_{T}$ beyond $|\eta|>5$ 
was found to be negligible.
Thus for the $\dyll$ background, the 
$\met$ is expected to be along the direction of the mis-measured jet. 
Figure~\ref{fig:dphijetmetmc} (a) shows the the angle between the $\met$ 
and the jet that is closest to the $\met$ in Drell-Yan MC at the ZZ preselection level. 
Figure~\ref{fig:dphijetmetmc} (b) shows the same distribution in data.
To reduce the $\dyll$ background
we veto events with $\delphijetmet < 0.5$. 
This selection is only applied if the jet $\pt>15\GeVc$. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:dphidilepjet_zzpresel} shows the variable 
%$\Delta\phi(\vec{p}_{\ell}, \text{leading jet})$ in data at
%the preselection level. The Drell-Yan background is predicted
%using the method described in Section \ref{sec:bkg_dy}.

the overflow bin, which represents events with no jet with $E_{T}>15$ GeV

%To reject the $\dytt$ background, we require the transverse mass of the dilepton system 
%and the missing energy, 
%\begin{equation}
%M_{T}^{2} = \left( \sqrt{p_{T\mathrm{ ll}}^{2} + M_{ll}^{2}} + \sqrt{(\met)^{2} + M_{ll}^{2}} \right)^{2} - \left(\vec{p_{T\mathrm{ ll}}} + \vec{\met}\right)^{2}. \\
%\label{eq:MTHZZ}
%\end{equation}
%Figure~\ref{fig:mtemloosesel} shows the $M_T$ distribution in the $e\mu$ final state for 
%various background. The \dytt\  background has a lower $M_T$ values compared to signal. 
%Therefore we apply $M_T>150\GeV$ as part of the $\ZZ$ preselection.
