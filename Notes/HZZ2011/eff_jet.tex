We apply a data-driven method to correct for instrumental effects on the jet 
counting efficiencies and its associated systematic uncertainties. 
In this method, the $H \to \ZZ$ jet counting efficiency in data 
$\epsilon_{H \to \ZZ}$ is corrected by a data-to-simulation scale factor 
obtained by comparing the jet counting efficiency in $\dyll$ enriched 
events in data with the value from simulation, 

$$\epsilon_{H \to \ZZ} = \epsilon_{\Z}^{data} (\frac{\epsilon_{H \to \ZZ}}{\epsilon_{\Z}})^{MC}.$$

The observed data-to-simulation correction factors are 
close to unity for the zero-jet and 1-jet bins.
As a result no correction is applied on top of the jet spectrum simualated 
for the Higgs signal, reweighted in the Higgs $\pt$ spectrum to the NNLO+NNLL differential calculation.
