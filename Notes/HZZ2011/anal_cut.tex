To enhance the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, we apply additional 
$m_{\rm{H}}$ hypothesis dependent selections on the 
minimum $\met$ and Higgs transverse mass ($M_{T}$) observables, 
covering a large Higgs boson mass ($m_{\rm{H}}$) range. 

The transverse mass is defined by

\begin{equation}
M_{T}^{2} = (\sqrt{p_{T\mathrm{ ll}}^{2} + M_{ll}^{2}} + \sqrt{(\met)^{2} + M_{ll}^{2}})^{2} - (\vec{p_{T\mathrm{ ll}}} + \vec{\met})^{2}. \\
\label{eq:MTHZZ}
\end{equation}

The higgs selection cuts are optimized for the significance ($\sqrt{S}/\sqrt{S+B}$)
separately in the 0-jet, 1-jet and 2-jet bins. The values of the cuts are summarized in
Tables \ref{tab:HiggsSelectionCutBased_0j}, \ref{tab:HiggsSelectionCutBased_1j}, and \ref{tab:HiggsSelectionCutBased_2j} for the 0-jet, 1-jet, and 2-jet bins. A one sided cut is
applied on the minimum \met and a two sided cut is applied on the transverse mass.

%% The quoted results in this section are scaled to 1 $\ifb$ of integrated luminosity. 
%% The background yields have been scaled taking into account the observed data 
%% corrections, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}, with the current data 
%% sample to give realistic estimations, while $gg \to H \to ZZ$ simulated 
%% events are reweighted to match the Higgs $\pt$ at NNLO, as explained in

%To enhance the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, two different approaches 
%are performed. The first one is a cut-based approach where further requirements 
%on a few observables are applied, while the second one makes use of
%multivariate techniques. Both of them cover a large Higgs boson mass
%($m_{\rm{H}}$) range, and each is separately optimized for different
%$m_{\rm{H}}$ hypotheses. The first method is the simplest approach with smaller
%systematic uncertainties. The second one is
%more powerful, since it exploits the information present in the
%correlation among the variables. 

%Output of the multivariate discriminator has two different use
%cases. In the first case we use it as just one more variable to cut on
%in the cut-based analysis. In the second case we use the discriminator
%output distribution for the final signal extraction.

%All analyses are further split in the corresponding 0-jet, 1-jet and
%2-jet bins. In the 2-jet bin we use a simple cut-based approach for
%now due to the limited sensitivity and the limited number of events in
%simulation.
