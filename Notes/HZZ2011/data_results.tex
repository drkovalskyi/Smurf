We perform the analysis on a dataset corresponding to \intlumi\ integrated luminosity. 
We document the results obtained after preselections
designed to control the level of agreement between the various background predictions
and the data in Sections \ref{sec:results_zzpresel} and \ref{sec:results_topww}.
The results of the mass-dependent $\hzz$ selections using cut-based 
(see Section~\ref{sec:anal_cutbased}) and shape based (see Section~\ref{sec:anal_mt}) approaches
are then reported in Sections \ref{sec:results_cut} and \ref{sec:results_mtshape} respectively.
