We perform the analysis on a dataset corresponding to $187\pm7\ipb$ integrated luminosity.

Table~\ref{tab:zzselection_all} shows the number of events observed in 
data, comparing to the expected background contribution at the \zz{} 
preselection level. The background estimation was discussed at Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:zz_0j_1} the distributions of key analysis variables observed in data, comparing 
to the SM expectations from simulation in the 0-jet bin final state.
