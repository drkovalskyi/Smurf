We derive upper limits on the SM gluon-fusion Higgs boson production cross section 
times the $\hzz\to 2\ell2\nu$ branching ratio for the $m_H = 250, 300 and 400\GeVcc$. 
The results are presented in terms of the ratio of the limits to the rate predicted 
by the SM as a function of the Higgs boson mass corresponding to an integrated 
luminosity of 1 $\ifb$ as a bench mark. 

The limits are derived with a statistical method based on Bayesian
inference~\cite{bayesian}, using a likelihood function from the
expected number of observed events modeled as a Poisson random
variable whose mean value is the sum of the contributions from signal
and background processes. We account for systematic
uncertainties in a form of nuisance parameters with a log-normal
pdf. Results are reported with a flat signal {\it prior}. To perform
the computation of the limits, the software package LandS~\cite{lands}
is used.
