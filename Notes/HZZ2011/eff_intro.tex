 
We used the tag and probe method on \dyll~events to measure both online and offline selection efficiencies.
%provide an unbiased, high-purity, 
%lepton sample with which to measure both online and offline selection efficiencies.
This method has been used successfully in previous CMS analyses 
\cite{ref:tagprobe_mit_w}\cite{ref:tagprobe_snt_top}\cite{HWW2010}. The detailed description and 
measurements can be found in Ref.~\cite{HWW2011AN}. In this section, we document the results 
that are applicable to the $\hzz$ analysis. 
To produce the overall data-MC scale factors to apply in the analysis, we factorise the efficiency measurements
into two steps such that
%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{total} = \varepsilon_{offline} \times \varepsilon_{trigger}.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%
The offline efficiency $\varepsilon_{offline} = \varepsilon_{offline}^{l1} \times \varepsilon_{offline}^{l2}$
is the product of the efficiencies of the two leptons and is discussed in more detail in Sections \ref{sec:eff_electron}
and \ref{sec:eff_muon} for electrons and muons respectively.
The trigger efficiency is measured with respect to the offline selection and
is discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:eff_trigger}.
