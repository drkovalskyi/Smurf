Since the production cross-section for Drell-Yan is several orders of magnitude 
higher than the $H \to ZZ$ signal, the Drell-Yan background poses a significant 
challenge. To the leading order, the Drell-Yan process does not contain \met\,  
and therefore its contribution is signficantly reduced by a tight \met selection. 
The residual Drell-Yan contribution in the signal region 
is mainly due to events with fake \met either due to energy mismeasurement of  
the hadronic recoil or momentum mismeasurement of the selected leptons. 
The contribution of events with fake \met due to the lepton momentum mismeasurement 
is expected to be small since we select events within a fairly tight (within $15$ GeV) window 
around the $Z$ boson pole mass. The background due to mismeasurement of the hadronic
recoil is the main source of Drell-Yan events contributing to the selected signal region.

The estimation of residual Drell-Yan background in the signal region depends highly 
our understanding of the \met tails which is sensitive to many factors such as 
the jet energy corrections, the number of pileup interactions, and energy from out of time
contributions. These effects are difficult to model precisely in the simulation.
Therfore we employ a data-driven method to estimate the \met distribution for the 
Drell-Yan background. For events without natural \met\, under the assumption that 
the fake \met is only resulting from mismeasurement of the hadronic recoil, we can use
$\gamma$+jets events as a control sample to predict the \met distribution in $Z$+jets
background events. If parameterized correctly in an observable that is highly correlated 
with the source of fake \met, one expects $\gamma$+jets events to provide an accurate
model of the \met distribution for $Z$+jets events, provided that the photon
is well measured and does not contribute to the \met.

\subsubsection{Photon Selection and Reweighting Procedure}
The photon data sample is selected by requiring one and only one photon passing reaonsably tight
identification and isolation requirements, summarized in Table \ref{tab:PhotonSelection} below 
\cite{MITHggNote}. 
An electron veto is imposed on the photon, requiring that no GSF electron which does not match to 
one leg of a well reconstructed conversion is sharing the same supercluster as the photon
candidate. This is intended to reduce contributions from W bosons decaying to electrons, misidentified
as photons. To reduce contamination from $W$+$\gamma$ events, we veto any events with one or 
more well identified leptons.

Since the fake \met is due to mismeasurement of the hadronic recoil, we parameterize the 
modelling of the \met distribution in the $p_{T}$ of the photon / dilepton system and 
the number of counted jets. Both variables are highly correlated with the behavior 
of the hadronic recoil. Reweighting factors are computed in bins of the number of counted jets
and the dilepton $p_{T}$ by dividing the corresponding two dimensional distributions
in the $\gamma$+jets data sample and the dilepton data sample:

\begin{eqnarray}
  w(p_{T},\mathrm{njet}) = \frac{\mathrm{N}_{\gamma+\mathrm{jets}}(p_{T},\mathrm{njet})}{\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{Z+jets}}(p_{T},\mathrm{njet})}.
\end{eqnarray}

In order for these reweighting factors to be insensitive to the presence of signal or backgrounds with 
real \met, we build these weight factors on a $\gamma$+jets and $Z$+jets sample imposing an anti-selection
on the minimum of the \met and the track \met at below $50$ GeV. For the $Z$+jets sample, 
the full $H \to ZZ$ preselection is imposed, 
including the top veto and the third lepton veto.

Finally, to model the \met distribution for the final selection we select $\gamma$+jets events
as above, imposing the preselection requirement that the photon $p_{T}$ is greater than $40$GeV,
and associate the corresponding weight factor $w(p_{T},\mathrm{njet})$ to each such event. To build
the track \met in the $\gamma$+jets events, we must consistently account for the momentum of
the photon since we intend it to model the dilepton system which would be included in the 
track \met in $Z$+jets events. To mitigate cases of inconsistencies between the particle flow 
photon reconstruction and the standard photon reconstruction, particularly for converted photons,
we do not include any charged particle flow candidates inside the ($\Delta$R $<0.4$) isolation cone 
of the photon in the track \met sum.
To model the transverse mass distribution, we draw a random number from a pre-determined dilepton
mass distribution and build the $m_{T}$ observable as in Eqn \ref{eq:MTHZZ}. The dilepton mass distribution
is constructed from data imposing all preselection cuts except the $\met\ $ requirement.

\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Closure Test}

In order to verify that the procedure models the $Z$+jet background well, we test it
in $\gamma$+jets and $Z$+jets Monte Carlo simulation. The reweighting factors are 
built from the simulation sample according to the procedure described above and then 
applied on the $\gamma$+jets Monte Carlo sample. 

%The photon and $Z$ 
%$p_{T}$ distributions are shown in Fig \ref{fig:PhotonJetsClosureTest_Pt} to demonstrate that 
%the reweighting is carried out consistently.

In Fig \ref{fig:PhotonJetsClosureTest_TrackMET} we show the particle flow \met distribution 
from the $\gamma$+jet sample after reweighting compared to the \met distribution from the 
$Z$+jet sample, separately in the 0-jet, 1-jet, and 2-jet bins. We observe agreement between 
the $\gamma$+jet generated prediction and the $Z$+jet simulation particle flow \met distribution. 
In Fig \ref{fig:PhotonJetsClosureTest_TrackMET} we show the analogous comparison for track \met, where 
is agreement slightly worse than for particle flow \met. Finally, in 
Fig \ref{fig:PhotonJetsClosureTest_TrackMET}, we show the comparison for the minimum of the 
track \met and the particle flow \met, which shows better agreement than the track \met alone.

\subsubsection{Systematic Uncertainties}

We derive the systematic uncertainty in two components.
First we account for the intrinsic systematic uncertainty on the method by comparing
the predicted and observed \met~distribution in the closure test described above.
This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:PhotonJetsClosureTest_MinMETRatio}.
From this we conclude a systematic uncertainty of 20\% in each jet bin.
The second part of the systematic uncertainty comes from a cross check in
the data itself.
This cross check is performed by re-deriving the weighting for the photon+jets sample in the region
$10<\met<30$~GeV and then using this to predict the number of events in the region
$30<\met<50$~GeV, which should still be dominated by Drell-Yan.
We then take the uncertainty as the relative difference between the central values
of the prediction and observations.
From this we conclude an additional systematic uncertainty of
15\%, 1\% and 5\% in the zero, one and two-jet bins respectively.
This uncertainty is added in quadrature with the first to give a total 
systematic uncertainty of 25\%, 20\% and 21\% respectively.

\subsubsection{Data Estimate}

We compared the predictions for the minimum \met and MT are compared with the  
data at the \zz preselection level to validate the method.
These comparisons are shown in Section \ref{sec:dataresults} in
Figures \ref{fig:minmet_zzpresel} and \ref{fig:mt_zzpresel} respectively.
This is done sparately for the 0-jet, 1-jet and 2-jet bins. 
Including all of the backgrounds with real \met, we find reasonable agreement with data. 
Based on the $\gamma$+jet sample prediction, we obtain the background predictions for the
preselection and all the mass dependent cut-based analyses summarized in Table \ref{tab:DYBkgPrediction}.
