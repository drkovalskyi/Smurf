The electron selection efficiency can be factorised into two contributions,
the efficiency from the electron reconstruction and from the additional
analysis selections that are described in Section~\ref{sec:sel_lepton}.

The electron reconstruction efficiency is defined as the efficiency for a
supercluster to be matched to a reconstructed ECAL driven GSF electron.
%The data to simulation scale factor was measured for the W and Z cross-section
%analysis~\cite{VBTFCrossSectionNote}~\cite{ref:tagprobe_mit_w},
%and found to be consistent with $1.0$ with a total uncertainty of
%$1.3\%$ and $1.5\%$ for the barrel and endcap, respectively.
The data to simulation scale factor was measure by the Egamma POG binned in
$p_T$ and $\eta$~\cite{ref:egamma_eff_gsf}. From these studies, we take an overall scale factor of
$0.99$ with an uncertainty of $2.0\%$.

We thus measure the efficiency of our offline analysis selection 
with respect to a reconstructed ECAL driven GSF electron denominator. 
The resulting data to simulation scale factors are given in Table~\ref{tab:eff_ele_offline}.
