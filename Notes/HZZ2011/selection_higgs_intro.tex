To enhance the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, two different approaches 
are performed. The first one is a cut-based approach where further requirements 
on a few observables are applied, while the second one makes use of
multivariate techniques. Both of them cover a large Higgs boson mass
($m_{\rm{H}}$) range, and each is separately optimized for different
$m_{\rm{H}}$ hypotheses. The first method is the simplest approach with smaller
systematic uncertainties. The second one is
more powerful, since it exploits the information present in the
correlation among the variables.

%To enhance the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, two different approaches

%Output of the multivariate discriminator has two different use
%cases. In the first case we use it as just one more variable to cut on
%in the cut-based analysis. In the second case we use the discriminator
%output distribution for the final signal extraction.

%All analyses are further split in the corresponding 0-jet, 1-jet and
%2-jet bins. In the 2-jet bin we use a simple cut-based approach for
%now due to the limited sensitivity and the limited number of events in
%simulation.
