To enhance the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, two different approaches 
are performed. The first one is a cut-based approach where further requirements 
on a few observables are applied. The second one makes use of shape of 
event kinematics, using either single kinematic observable $M_T$ or 
a discriminant from multivariate techinque such as Matrix Element and BDT. 
Both of them cover a large Higgs boson mass ($m_{\rm{H}}$) range, 
and each is separately optimized for different
$m_{\rm{H}}$ hypotheses. The first method is the simplest approach. 
The second one is more powerful as it explores the difference in the kinematic 
shapes instead of doing orthognal cuts. This helps in categorization of the 
events in different S/B regions. 
The shapes based on the multivariate techiques adds additional improvement 
compared to the single observable shape as it exploits the 
correlation among the variables. 
		

%The cut-based analysis is described in this section, while the shape based analysis using 
%the $M_T$ is described in section~\ref{sec:anal_mt} and the shape based analysis using the 
%Matrix element out put is described in section~\ref{sec:anal_me}.

%To enhance the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, two different approaches 
%are performed. The first one is a cut-based approach where further requirements 
%on a few observables are applied, while the second one makes use of
%multivariate techniques. Both of them cover a large Higgs boson mass
%($m_{\rm{H}}$) range, and each is separately optimized for different
%$m_{\rm{H}}$ hypotheses. The first method is the simplest approach with smaller
%systematic uncertainties. The second one is
%more powerful, since it exploits the information present in the
%correlation among the variables. 

%Output of the multivariate discriminator has two different use
%cases. In the first case we use it as just one more variable to cut on
%in the cut-based analysis. In the second case we use the discriminator
%output distribution for the final signal extraction.

%All analyses are further split in the corresponding 0-jet, 1-jet and
%2-jet bins. In the 2-jet bin we use a simple cut-based approach for
%now due to the limited sensitivity and the limited number of events in
%simulation.
