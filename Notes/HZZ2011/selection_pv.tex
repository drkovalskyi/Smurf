Primary vertices are reconstructed using the Deterministic Annealing (DA) 
clustering of tracks~\cite{PVDA}. Reconstructed primary vertices are required to have a
$z$ position within 24~cm of the nominal detector center and a radial position within 
2~cm of the beamspot. The number of degrees of freedom is required to be greater than four
in the fitted vertex. From the set of primary vertices in the event passing these
selection cuts, the vertex with the largest summed squared-$\pt$ of the associated
tracks is chosen as the event primary vertex. Reconstructed leptons will be required 
to have small impact parameters with respect to this vertex.

Due to the fast evolution of the LHC machine, with a rapid rise in the
instantaneous luminosity, the data taking conditions have changed
rapidly.  In particular it is difficult to exactly reproduce the
number of overlapping events (i.e. pileup) between data and
simulation, and thus there will be differences in the number of
reconstructed primary vertices. We correct the number of pileup events 
in the simulation by reweighting the number of generated in-time pileup 
interactions to match the values corresponding to the instanenous luminosity.
