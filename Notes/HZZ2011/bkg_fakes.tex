Jet induced fake leptons are an important source of background for many 
physics channels. The main sources of fake leptons are
$\Wjets$ and QCD events, where at least one of the jets or a
constituent is misidentified as an isolated lepton. 
The dominant background is $\Wjets$ because there is already one prompt, 
well isolated, lepton from the $W$ boson decay.
Fake non-prompt leptons arise from the leptonic decay
of heavy quarks, misidentified hadrons or electrons from 
photon conversion. Due to the stringent requirement on the 
identification, isolation, and the $p_{T}$ of the leptons 
(see section~\ref{sec:selection}), this background contribution 
is expected to be very small.

We estimate this background using the fake rate method described in 
detail in Ref.~\cite{HWW2011AN}. We find no events containing one
tight lepton and one fakeable object which fails the tight selection,
and therefore the fake lepton background contribution is 0 for all
Higgs mass hypotheses.
