We have described the planned methodology for a search for $\Hi\to\ZZ\to2\ell2\nu$ decays in $pp$ collision 2011 data at
$\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ with the CMS detector. 
We presented signal extraction and background estimation techniques along with 
their expected systematic uncertainties. 
We applied the methodology described to the currently available dataset containing \intlumi of integrated luminosity
collected during the 2011 run, and show the results. With the current data sample, 
we are expected to exclude the standard model Higgs boson in the mass range of 
about $325-435~\GeVcc$ in the cut-baed analysis. 
The exclusion region extends to about $310-450~\GeVcc$ using shape analysis based on $M_T$ variable. 

%We have implemented the preliminary version of the matrix element method 
%for this search and validated the method by measuring the $\WZ/\ZZ$ cross-section 
%using the \intlumi\ data. 
%The expected limits based on MC shows that 
%the matrix element method based analysis has improvements in the sensitivity.
