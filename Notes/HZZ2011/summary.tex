We have described the planned methodology for a search for $\Hi\to\ZZ\to2\ell2\nu$ decays in $pp$ collision 2011 data at
$\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ with the CMS detector. 
We presented signal extraction and background estimation techniques along with 
their expected systematic uncertainties. 
We applied the methodology described to the currently available dataset containing \intlumi of integrated luminosity
collected during the 2011 run, and show the results. With the currrent data sample the expected 
upper limit is about 2.4 times the expectation of a Higgs boson of 300~$\GeVcc$.
