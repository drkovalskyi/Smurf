We have performed a search for $\Hi\to\ZZ\to2\ell2\nu$ decays in $pp$ collision 2011 data at
$\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ with the CMS detector. 
We presented signal extraction and background estimation techniques along with 
their expected systematic uncertainties. 
We analysed the currently available dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \intlumi 
collected during the 2011 run. 

With the current data sample, we expect to exclude the standard model Higgs boson 
in the mass range of about [300,450]~\GeVcc in the cut-based analysis, compared with the 
expected exclusion range of [300,475]~\GeVcc. 
The observed exclusion region extends to about [275-455]~\GeVcc using shape analysis based on 
the $M_T$ variable, compared to the expected exclusion range of [290-490]~\GeVcc.
The observed exclusion region extends to about [300-500]~\GeVcc using shape analysis based on 
matrix element output, compared to the expected exclusion range of [280-480]~\GeVcc.
