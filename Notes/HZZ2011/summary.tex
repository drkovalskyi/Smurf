We have performed a search for $\Hi\to\ZZ\to2\ell2\nu$ decays in $pp$ collision 2011 data at
$\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ with the CMS detector. 
We presented signal extraction and background estimation techniques along with 
their expected systematic uncertainties. 
We analysed the currently available dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \intlumi 
collected during the 2011 run. With the current data sample, 
we expect to exclude the standard model Higgs boson in the mass range of 
about $325-435~\GeVcc$ in the cut-based analysis. 
The exclusion region extends to about $310-450~\GeVcc$ using shape analysis based on $M_T$ variable. 

%We have implemented the preliminary version of the matrix element method 
%for this search and validated the method by measuring the $\WZ/\ZZ$ cross-section 
%using the \intlumi\ data. 
%The expected limits based on MC shows that 
%the matrix element method based analysis has improvements in the sensitivity.
