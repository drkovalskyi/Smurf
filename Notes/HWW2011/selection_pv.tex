{\fixme need to say something about the DA PV method}

To select a good primary vertex we require a position in $z$ smaller than 
24~cm, a radius smaller than 2~cm and a number of degrees of freedom greater 
than 4. Out of the selected ones, we assign each lepton candidate to the one 
closest in $z$. Finally, at the event selection level, we require all leptons 
to be closer in $z$ by less than 2~cm. The last cut rejects a sizable 
fraction of $\Wjets$  events, where a fake lepton is selected from additional 
overlapping events.
