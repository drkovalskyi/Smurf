To enhance the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, two different approaches 
are performed. The first one is a cut-based approach where further requirements 
on a few observables are applied, while the second one makes use of
multivariate techniques. Both of them cover a large Higgs boson mass
($m_{\rm{H}}$) range, and each is separately optimized for different
$m_{\rm{H}}$ hypotheses. The first method is the simplest approach to
be performed on the limited recorded data sample. The second one is
more powerful, since it exploits the information present in the
correlation among the variables. All analyses are further split in 
the corresponding 0-jet, 1-jet and 2-jet bins. Due to the limited 
sensitivity in the 2-jet bin and the little amount of simulated events, 
we decided to have a simple cut-based approach only for now.
