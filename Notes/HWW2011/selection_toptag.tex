We use a dedicated top tagging veto, which allows to further suppress the
background as well as to estimate the remaining background. More details about the 
yield estimation are found in Section.~\ref{sec:backgrounds}.

The top tagging consists of two main parts: soft muon tagging and
$b$-jet tagging for jets below and above the jet $\pt$ threshold. The soft muon
selection requirements are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\pt > 3$ GeV;
\item is a TrackerMuon;
\item passed $TMLastStationAngTight$ muon id requirements;
\item number of valid inner tracker hits is more than 10;
\item impact parameter in the transverse plane $|d_{0}| < 2$~mm,
      calculated with respect to the primary vertex;
\item muons with $\pt > 20$~GeV have to be non-isolated with 
      $\frac{\rm{Iso}_{Total}}{\pt}~>~0.1$.
\end{itemize}

The $b$-jet tagging requirements consist of finding any jet from
the $ak5PFJet$ collection that passed the $TrkCountingHighEff$~\cite{btag} 
tagger having a discriminating value greater than 2.1.
