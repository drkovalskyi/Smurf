To further reduce Drell--Yan background in the $\Ep\Em$ and $\Mp\Mm$ final
states a $\Z$ veto is defined, by which events with a dilepton
invariant mass within 15~$\GeVcc$ of the $\Z$ mass are discarded.
Events are also rejected with dilepton masses below 12~$\GeVcc$ to
suppress contributions from low mass resonances.
