{\fixme This is just an introduction}

Jet induced fake leptons are an important source of background for many 
physics channels. In this specific case the main backgrounds are
$\Wjets$ and QCD events, where at least one of the jets or its
constituents is misidentified as an isolated lepton. $\Wjets$ is the
dominant background with one prompt well isolated lepton from the $W$
boson decay and a fake non-prompt lepton from either a leptonic decay
of heavy quarks, a misidentified hadron or an electron from photon
conversion.

A data-driven approach, described in detail in~\cite{fakeLeptonNote1} 
and~\cite{fakeLeptonNote2}, is pursued to estimate this background. 
A set of loosely selected lepton-like objects is defined in a sample of events 
dominated by dijet production. The probability is calculated for those objects 
that are misidentified as leptons passing all lepton selection criteria. This 
misidentification probability, parameterized as a function of $\pt$ and $\eta$, 
is then applied to a sample of events selected using the final selection 
criteria, except for one of the leptons for which the selection has been 
relaxed to the looser criteria and that has failed the nominal selection.
