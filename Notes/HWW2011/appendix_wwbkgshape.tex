In this section we study the uncertainties on the shape of the MVA output of the 
standard model qq $\rightarrow$ WW production process. Since we obtain the shape 
of the MVA output from the Monte Carlo simulation, the shape uncertainty is 
primarily driven by theoretical uncertainties of the prediction, in particular
the higher order corrections. The Monte Carlo simulation sample used to predict
the MVA shape prediction has been produced by Madgraph. To study the shape uncertainties
we compare the MVA shape prediction from a full simulation sample produced by MC@NLO
and the MVA shape prediction from the Madgraph Monte Carlo sample. To study the 
sensitivity to higher order corrections beyond the next-to-leading order term
we vary the factorization and renormalization scale by factors of $1/2$ and $2$ and
compare the change in the shape of the MVA output.
