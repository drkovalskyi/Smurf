This appendix describes the ``reload'' of the analysis described in the body
of this document for the Lepton Photon 2011 conference.
The reload primarily adds extra data to the existing analysis, but also 
includes minor technical changes described in this appendix.
We define the following naming conventions for the analyses described:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The EPS analysis refers to the methods and results documented in the body of this note.
    \item The LP analysis refers to the application of the EPS analysis methods to the extended dataset.
\end{itemize}

We define the following naming conventions for the datasets used:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The EPS dataset refers to the initial $\sim$ \intlumi~dataset described in Section \ref{sec:datasets}.
    \item The post-EPS dataset refers to the $\sim$ 0.5 fb$^{-1}$ dataset recorded after the EPS2011 conference.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item August 5th ReReco $XXX<run<YYY$.
        \item PromptReco V6 $AAA<run<BBB$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The LP dataset refers to the total $\sim$ \lpintlumi~dataset.
\end{itemize}

We performed this reload according to the following methodology:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We first identified a number of necessary technical changes to the analysis.  
These are summarised in Section \ref{app:lp_technical_changes}.
    \item We validated the post-EPS data against our expectations from the EPS data.
The comparisons of the new and old data and documented in Section \ref{app:lp_validation}.
    \item We then performed the background estimations for the full dataset in Section \ref{app:lp_bkgestim}.
    \item We performed the analysis separately on the EPS and post-EPS datasets, 
as well as the sum of the two in Section \ref{app:lp_limits}.
\end{itemize}

The changes introduced in the reload are now described.
