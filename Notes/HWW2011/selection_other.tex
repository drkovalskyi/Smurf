To reduce the background from diboson processes, we veto events
containing an additional lepton meeting the previously described selection requirements
with $\pt > 10~\GeVc$.
This removes $\sim 60\%$ of the $WZ$ component but only $\sim 10\%$ on the $ZZ$ component,
which is dominated by $\ZZ \to 2l2\nu$ decays after the full event selection.
The efficiency for $WW \to 2l2\nu$ events is $\sim 99.9\%$.
