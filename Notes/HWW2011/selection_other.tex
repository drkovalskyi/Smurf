To further reject the background from diboson processes, we reject any event
which has an additional fully identified lepton with $\pt > 10~\GeVc$. The 
$WZ$ component is mostly rejected by requiring that there be only two high 
$\pt$ isolated leptons in the event. The smaller cross-section times branching 
ratio of the $ZZ$ component, and the fact that the missing energy is rather 
small for such events, make this kind of background almost negligible after 
the full selection. The remaining contribution from $\WZ \to 3l\nu$ decays is
largely rejected by the tri-lepton removal. Only 40\% of 
the $WZ$ events survive the requirement. On the other hand, after all other 
requirements the remaining contribution from $\ZZ \to 2l2\nu$ decays. Hence, 
the tri-lepton removal keeps $\sim$90\%  of the $ZZ$ events. This requirement 
has an efficiency of $\sim$99.9\% for $WW \to 2l2\nu$ events.
