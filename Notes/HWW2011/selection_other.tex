To reduce the background from diboson processes, we veto events
containing an additional lepton meeting the previously described selection requirements
with $\pt > 10~\GeVc$.
This removes $\sim 60\%$ of the $WZ$ component but only $\sim 10\%$ on the $ZZ$ component,
which is dominated by $\ZZ \to 2l2\nu$ decays after the full event selection and surviving the Z veto.
The efficiency for $WW \to 2l2\nu$ events is $\sim 99.9\%$. 
Finally, the angle in the transverse 
plane between the dilepton system and the most energetic jet with 
$\pt^{jet}~>~15~\GeV$ must be smaller than $165$ degrees in the 
$ee/\mu\mu$ final states. This requirements rejects $\dyll$ events, where 
the $\Z$ bosn recoil against a jet.
