The multivariate shape analysis gives the best sensitivity in computing the upper limits, 
as shown in Section~\ref{sec:results} and Section~\ref{sec:dataresults}. 
The inputs to the limits are the binned histograms of the multivariate discriminant for 
data and the backgrounds.  
In the current implementation of LandS~\cite{lands} package, 
the statistical uncertainties associated with the background template 
can only be included as the uncertainty of the overall expected yields.  
As the statistical uncertainty at each bin is larger than the overall uncertainty, 
this simpfied approach could lead to an overestimated limit. 
The exact impact depends on the size of the background samples from which 
the background template is built upon. 

In this section, we describe a procedure to correctly account for the bin-by-bin 
statistical uncertainties and estimate the effects on the measured upperlimits shown in 
Section~\ref{sec:dataresults}. In this procedure, instead of using the histograms directly 
as an input to the LandS calculation, we write out an input card for each bin in which 
the correct statistical uncertainty is used. We then combine these cards to compute the 
upper limits. If the background template at a given bin is empty, we flucturate the 
bin content equal to one even count and assign 100\% relative uncertainty. 
The results obtained this way is then compared with the default 
shape analysis results to evaulate the effects, as tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:shapeuncertain}.
