The electron selection efficiency can be factorised into two contributions,
the efficiency from the electron reconstruction and from the additional
analysis selections that are described in Section~\label{sec:sel_electrons}.

The electron reconstruction efficiency is defined as the efficiency for a
supercluster to be matched to a reconstructed ECAL driven GSF electron.
The data to simulation scale factor was measured for the W and Z cross-section
analysis~\cite{VBTFCrossSectionNote}~\cite{ref:tagprobe_mit_w},
and found to be consistent with $1.0$ with a total uncertainty of
$1.3\%$ and $1.5\%$ for the barrel and endcap, respectively.

We thus measure the efficiency of our offline analysis selection 
with respect to a reconstructed ECAL driven GSF electron denominator. 
The resulting data to simulation scale factors are given in Table \ref{tab:eff_ele_offline}.
