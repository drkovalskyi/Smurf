\subsection{Same Sign Control Sample}
\label{sec:FakeLeptonBkgSameSignControlSample}
Further closure tests on the fake lepton background estimate can be performed using data events
with two same sign leptons. This control sample is highly enriched in W+Jet background and 
can serve as an additional cross-check of the systematic uncertainties estimated above from 
Monte Carlo simulation. Table \ref{tab:FakeLeptonBkgPrediction_SameSignSample} summarizes the 
total fake lepton background estimate using the fake rate method after the WW selection 
where we require that the two leptons have the same charge instead of opposite charge. After
subtracting the WZ and W$\gamma$ background, we obtain an observed yield of $12.2$ and 
predict a yield of $9.0$. The difference is about $35\%$ and less than one standard deviation.
The result of this cross-check is perfectly consistent with the uncertainties 
estimated in the previous sections, demonstrating that the extrapolation systematics
estimated from the Monte Carlo simulation is applicable to data.
