We use a combination of data-driven methods and detailed Monte Carlo
simulation studies to estimate background contributions.  From data we
can estimate the following backgrounds: $\Wjets$, $\dyll$, $\WZ$ and
$\ZZ$ (for events where both leptons come from a $\dyll$), top
background and \WW{}. The rest of processes are taken from simulation.

For each studied Higgs mass region, the background estimated in the $\WW$
preselection is then extrapolated into the studied region, taking into account 
the effects of the selection criteria, as determined from simulation.
