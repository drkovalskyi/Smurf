The estimation of the different background components is summarized in this
section, where a combination of data-driven methods and detailed Monte
Carlo simulation studies is used. 
From data, we estimate: $\Wjets$, $\dyll$, $\WZ$ and $\ZZ$ (for events where 
both leptons come from a $\dyll$). Top background is verified on data. The rest 
of processes are taken from simulation.

For each studied Higgs mass region, the background estimated in the $\WW$
preselection is then extrapolated into the studied region, taking into account 
the effects of the selection criteria, as determined from simulation.
