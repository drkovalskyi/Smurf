This note describes the search for $H \to \WW$ decays of $pp$ collision
2011 data at $\sqrt{s} = $ 7~TeV with the CMS detector. The $\W$ 
leptonic decay channels with $e,~\mu$ in the final state are considered. We 
present the event yields, together with the background expectations and the 
systematic uncertainties. The methods for obtaining signal and background 
efficiencies and systematic uncertainties directly from the data samples are 
discussed. Signal and background yields are extrapolated to 1 $\ifb$ of 
collected data to obtain sensible projections.
