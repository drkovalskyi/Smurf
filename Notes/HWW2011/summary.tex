We have described the planned methodology for a search for $\Hi\to\WW$ decays in $pp$ collision 2011 data at
$\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ with the CMS detector. 
We presented signal extraction and background estimation techniques along with 
their expected systematic uncertainties. 
We applied the methodology described to the currently available dataset containing $\intlumi$ of integrated luminosity
collected during the 2011 run and showed the results. With the currrent data sample we are able
to exclude the SM Higgs boson in the mass range $150-195~\GeVcc$.
