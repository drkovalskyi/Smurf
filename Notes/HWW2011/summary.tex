We have described the planned methodology for a search for $\Hi\to\WW$ decays in $pp$ collision 2011 data at
$\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ with the CMS detector. 
We presented signal extraction and background estimation techniques along with 
their expected systematic uncertainties. 
We applied the methodology described to the currently available dataset containing $49~\ipb$ of integrated luminosity
collected during the 2011 run, and show the results. 
We will update these results as we have more processed certified data.

To estimate the sensitivity we could expect with more data, we projected the expected yields 
in a dataset containing an integrated luminosity of $1~\ifb$.
Using these projections, we expect to be able to exclude a SM Higgs boson in the mass range $130-205~ \GeVcc$.
