We have described the planned methodology for a search for $\Hi\to\WW$ decays in $pp$ collision 2011 data at
$\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ with the CMS detector. 
We presented signal extraction and background estimation techniques along with 
their expected systematic uncertainties. 
We applied the methodology described to the currently available dataset containing $192~\ipb$ of integrated luminosity
collected during the 2011 run, and show the results. With the currrent data sample the expected 
(observed) upper limit is about 0.8 (1.3) times the expectation of a Higgs boson of 160~$\GeVcc$.

To estimate the sensitivity we could expect with more data, we projected the expected yields 
in a dataset containing an integrated luminosity of $1~\ifb$.
Using these projections, we expect to be able to exclude a SM Higgs boson in the mass range $130-205~ \GeVcc$.
