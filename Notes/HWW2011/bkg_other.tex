There are four processes which need to be estimated from Monte Carlo 
simulation, after applying the proper data corrections for lepton, trigger 
and jet veto efficiencies, in this low luminosity regime: $WZ$, 
$ZZ$, $W+\gamma$, $\dytt$.

$WZ$ and $ZZ$ events with lepton pairs from a resonant $Z$ boson are suppressed by the  
$Z$ veto. The remaining contribution is expected to be well modeled in the simulation
and thus the Monte Carlo prediction is used.

The $W+\gamma$ background, where the $\gamma$ fakes an electron through
an asymmetric conversion is difficult to estimate from data. Additional
cross-checks can be performed to place data based constraints on this estimate. 
For instance, applying the same standard selection, but requiring two same-sign 
leptons, gives a sample dominated by $\Wjets$ and $W+\gamma$ events. Again, the 
expected contribution is very small, due to stringent $\gamma$ conversion 
requirements explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:sel_electrons}.

The $\dytt$ background, where both $\tau$ leptons decay into the $\Lep\Nu\Nu$ 
final state, is difficult to estimate directly from data since it does not 
produce a resonant mass peak. Nevertheless, both the leptonic 
branching ratios and cross-section are well-known, and the process is 
relatively clean with two leptons in the final state. Hence, we can rely on 
the Monte Carlo expectations to estimate this background. In addition, the 
expected contribution is small due to the $\met$ and $p_{T}$ requirements, since 
leptons from the $\tau$ decays are typically soft.

The contribution for all these processes after all $\WW$-like requirements is given 
in Table~\ref{tab:diboson_bck} for the three jet-bins for an 
integrated luminosity of \intlumi.
