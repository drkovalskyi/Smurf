We apply a data-driven method to estimate the $\dyll$ contributions in the 
same flavor $\ell^+\ell^-$ final states. This method also provides an estimate 
for the \emph{peaking component} of $WZ$ and $ZZ$ contributions, in which both 
leptons come from the same $Z$ boson.

The expected contributions from $\dyll$ events outside the $Z$-mass 
region in data can be estimated by counting the number of events near 
the $Z$ mass region in data, subtracting from it the non-$Z$ contributions, 
and scaling it by a ratio $R_{out/in}$ defined as
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
N_{out}^{ll,exp} = R_{out/in}^{ll,loose}(N_{in}^{ll} - 0.5N_{in}^{e\mu}k_{ll}), 
\label{eq:dyest}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $k_{ee} = \sqrt{\frac{N_{in}^{ee,loose}}{N_{in}^{\mu\mu,loose}}}$ for 
$\dyee$ and $k_{mm} = \sqrt{\frac{N_{in}^{\mu\mu,loose}}{N_{in}^{ee,loose}}}$ 
for $\dymm$. $R_{out/in}$ is obtained from simulation as 
$N_{out}^{MC}/N_{in}^{MC}$ with no $\met$ cut (referred to as a loose 
selection). The non-$Z$ contributions close to the $Z$-mass region in data is 
estimated from the number of events in the $e^\pm\mu^\mp$ final state 
$N_{in}^{e\mu}$, applying a correction factor that normalizes the 
electron-to-muon efficiency $k_{ee/\mu\mu}$. 
%To validate this method, we apply it first on events with no $\met$ cut. 
%These events are dominated by $\dyll$. A good agreement within 10\% between 
%the predictions from the data-driven method and simulation is observed. 
The method relies on on the assumption that the dependence of the ratio $R_{out/in}$ 
on the $\met$ cut is well modelled by the simulation and is relatively flat. 
%An estimate of the degree to which this assumption fails is shown in  
Figure~\ref{fig:routin_met} shows the ratios $R_{out/in}$ as functions of 
the $\met$ cut at different jet bins. 
In the zero-jet bin, we have observed an increase of the 
ratio with respect to the $\met$ cut mainly due to the correlation of the 
$\met$ and the di-lepton mass measurement. The measurement of $R_{out/in}$ is taken 
from simulation with a looser $\met$ cut at 20 GeV as the statistics at the 
nominal cut value (35 GeV) is limited. The systematic uncertainty is assigned as the 
largest difference in the ratio to the central value as we vary the $\met$ cut from 
0 to 35 GeV. The results are tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:Routinmc}. 
We cross-checked the $R_{out/in}$ value in data as 
$(N_{out}^{ll} - 0.5N_{out}^{e\mu}k_{ll})/(N_{in}^{ll} - 0.5N_{in}^{e\mu}k_{ll})$, the 
dependence of which on the $\met$ cut is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:routin_met_data}.
