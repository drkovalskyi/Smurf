We apply a data-driven method to estimate the $\dyll$ contributions in the 
same flavor $\ell^+\ell^-$ final states. This method also provides an estimate 
for the \emph{peaking component} of $WZ$ and $ZZ$ contributions, in which both 
leptons come from the same $Z$ boson.

The expected contributions from $\dyll$ events outside the $Z$-mass 
region in data can be estimated by counting the number of events near 
the $Z$ mass region in data, subtracting from it the non-$Z$ contributions, 
and scaling it by a ratio $R_{out/in}$ defined as
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
N_{out}^{ll,exp} = R_{out/in}^{ll,loose}(N_{in}^{ll} - 0.5N_{in}^{e\mu}k_{ll}), 
\label{eq:dyest}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $k_{ee} = \sqrt{\frac{N_{in}^{ee,loose}}{N_{in}^{\mu\mu,loose}}}$ for 
$\dyee$ and $k_{mm} = \sqrt{\frac{N_{in}^{\mu\mu,loose}}{N_{in}^{ee,loose}}}$ 
for $\dymm$. $R_{out/in}$ is obtained from simulation as 
$N_{out}^{MC}/N_{in}^{MC}$ with no $\met$ cut (referred to as a loose 
selection). The non-$Z$ contributions close to the $Z$-mass region in data is 
estimated from the number of events in the $e^\pm\mu^\mp$ final state 
$N_{in}^{e\mu}$, applying a correction factor that normalizes the 
electron-to-muon efficiency $k_{ee/\mu\mu}$. 

To validate this method, we apply it first on events with no $\met$ cut. 
These events are dominated by $\dyll$. A good agreement within 10\% between 
the predictions from the data-driven method and simulation is observed. The 
dominant systematic uncertainty of this method arises from the dependence of 
$R_{out/in}$ on the $\met$ cut.
