We apply a data-driven method to estimate the $H \to \WW$ jet counting 
efficiency and its systematic uncertainties in data. In this method, the 
$H \to \WW$ jet counting efficiency in data is estimated as the value obtained 
from simulation, multiplied by a data over simulation scale factor, which is 
derived from $\dyll$ events.

\begin{center}
$\epsilon_{H \to \WW} = \epsilon_{\Z}^{data} (\frac{\epsilon_{H \to \WW}}{\epsilon_{\Z}})^{MC}$
\end{center}

The efficiency uncertainty of $H \to \WW$ can be factorized into the 
$\Z$ efficiency uncertainty in data and $H \to \WW/\Z$ efficiency ratio 
uncertainty in simulation. The former is statistically dominated, while 
theoretical uncertainties due to higher order corrections contribute most 
to the $H \to \WW/\Z$ efficiency ratio uncertainties. 

The $\dyll$ jet efficiencies are measured in data and compared with the 
values obtained from Powheg simulation. The data over simulation 
correction factor is close to unity for the 0-jet and 1-jet bins, while we 
observe some disagreement for events with at least two reconstructd jets. This 
is not surprising since Powheg is a NLO generator. The comparison between data 
and Madgraph simulation for instance gives much better agreement in that jet 
bin. Since the Higgs $\pt$ spectrum is reweighted to NNLO+NNLL for the Higgs 
simulation, we think this is properly taken care. The jet multiplicity 
distribution for $\dyll$ events is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:njets_dyll}. Events
with at least two reconstructed jets have been reweighted by a factor 1.6, 
which is the observed ratio between Madgraph and Powheg simulated events.
