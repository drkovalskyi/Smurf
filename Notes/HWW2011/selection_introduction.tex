In this section we define the common objects and preselection requirements 
used by all of the approaches considered in this analysis.

The fully leptonic final state consistens of two isolated leptons
and large missing energy from the two undetectable neutrinos.
This is the same final state as the non-resonant $\WW$ background.
The Higgs cross-section is several orders of magnitude lower than
the major reducible background processes: \ttbar{}, \wjets{} and Drell-Yan. 
We thus perform several steps to select and extract the Higgs boson signal from data:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We select events that pass pre-defined lepton triggers
    \item We then select those with the final state described above:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Two opposite charge leptons ($ee$, $\mu\mu$, $e\mu$)
            \item $\pt>20~\GeVc$ for the leading lepton and $\pt>10~\GeVc$ for the trailing lepton.
            \item Standard identification and isolation requirements
        \end{itemize}    
    \item We apply a common $\WW$ preselection with no restriction on the number of reconstructed jets
    \item Finally, we perform two \emph{Higgs mass dependent} event selections; one cut-based and one using a multivariate technique. 
\end{enumerate}

These steps are now described in detail.
