To split the analysis in different jet bins, we count events 
containing jets with $\pt > ~30~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<5.0$. Jets are 
reconstructed using calorimeter and tracker information using a particle flow 
algorithm~\cite{jetpas}. The anti-${\rm k_T}$ clustering algorithm~\cite{antikt} 
with ${\rm R=0.5}$ is used. We apply the standard jet energy 
corrections~\cite{jes} to the reconstructed jets, where the L1 Fast Jets 
corrections are included. The latter corrections are rather important since 
they help in flatening the reconstruction efficiency as a function of the 
number of overlapping events.

The performance of the jet veto is validated on data using Drell-Yan events, 
as will be explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:backgrounds}. To exclude electrons and 
muons from the jet sample, the jets are required to be separated from the 
selected leptons by at least $\Delta R^{\mathrm{jet-lepton}}>0.3$.
