This analysis does not have any clear mass peak anywhere, hence is to a 
large extend a counting experiment, and therefore it is important to understand the 
signal efficiency and the estimation of the backgrounds. The following sources 
of systematic uncertainties have been taken into account:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Luminosity:} This uncertainty is coming directly from the official
CMS result, which is around 4\%.

\item {\it Lepton identification and trigger efficiencies:} 
these efficiencies for real leptons are measured in data by using the so-called 
`tag and probe" strategy. This is explained in detail in 
Section~\ref{sec:efficiency}. The estimated uncertainty is about 2\% per lepton
leg.

\item {\it Momentum scale:} 
Due to several factors, the energy scale for electrons and the momentum 
scale for muons have relatively large uncertainties for the current data 
reconstruction version. Hence, we need to assign a systematic uncertainty by 
varying the transverse momentum of the muons by 1\%, 
and 2\% and 5\% for electrons in the barrel and the endcap, respectively. 
The contribution to the uncertainty on dilepton events is about 1.5\%.

\item {\it $\met$ modeling:} we have a data-driven method to estimate the $\dyll$
background, which is largely affected by the $\met$ resolution. Nevertheless events
with neutrinos in the final state have also a small uncertainty. To study it, we
assign an additional 10\% smearing to the uncertainty and check the effect on the
analysis. The dilepton efficiencies vary by around 1\%.

\item {\it Background estimation:} 
The methods to estimate the different background are explained in 
Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}, we summarize here the systematic uncertainties
associated to the methods.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\WW$ Background: the relative uncertainty on this background is about 
  50\% for $\sim$50 $\ipb$, and about 20\% for 1 $\ifb$. There is an additional
  uncertainty on the $gg \to WW$ component, which is around 50\% on that fraction.
  \item Jet induced backgrounds, $\Wjets$ and $QCD$: the associated systematic
  uncertainty is 50\%, mainly dominated from the closure tests performed on
  simulated events. With 50-100 $\ipb$ the statistical component of the uncertainty
  is also very sizable. 
  \item Top background: this background is estimated by looking at b-tagged events
  and extrapolating to the signal region given that the b-tagging efficiency is
  measured in other control samples. The systematic uncertainties associated to
  the method are below 5\%, while the statistical component is about 50\% for 50
  $\ipb$ and decreases to 20\% with 1 $\ifb$.
  \item Drell-Yan background. The uncertainty is dominated by the knowledge of the
  events at large $\met$ tails. The current conservative estimate is 100\%,
  although the effect on the final analysis is small, since very few $\dyll$ events
  are selected.
  \item Other backgrounds. These backgrounds are directly estimated from simulated
  events, hence we need to consider the uncertainty on their cross section. It is
  about 3\% for $\WZ$ and $\ZZ$ events and about 10\% for $W+\gamma$ events.
  \end{itemize}

\item {\it Higgs cross section:} these uncertainties are taken from the Higgs cross
section working group~\cite{LHCHiggsCrossSectionWorkingGroup:2011ti}. The uncertainty 
on the $gg \to H$ production is about 15\% and it is one of the dominant effects.

\item {\it Jet counting and theoretical uncertainties:} 
we need to make sure that the jet multiplicity is well reproduced by our 
simulation since we split our analysis in different jet bins. Experimental 
and theoretical uncertainties play a role, The experimental 
jet counting efficiency is measured in data using $\dyll$ events with a precision
already better than 1\% at this moment. There is also an uncertainty due to the
different jet $\pt$ spectrum between $\dyll$ and Higgs events, which is about 1\%. 
Concerning the theoretical part, we consider the uncertainties coming from the 
Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), the uncertainty due to higher 
order corrections and the effect of the fragmentation and 
hadronization process. The overall uncertainties on the signal efficiency are 
about 7\%, 10\% and 20\% for the 0-jet, 1-jet and 2-jet bins.

\item {\it Monte Carlo statistics:} the limited amount of simulated events has 
also been taken into account. The contribution is about 2-3\% for the signal
efficiencies, but it is as large as 100\% for some background components on specific
Higgs mass points.
\end{itemize}
 
\subsection{Summary of Systematic Uncertainties}
The summary of all systematic uncertainties taken into account in the analysis 
is shown in Table~\ref{tab:systww}. The total 
uncertainty depends on the Higgs mass case and jet bin, but it is about 35\% on the 
background estimation, while it is about 20\% on the signal efficiency. These results 
assume an integrated luminosity of about 1 $\ifb$.
