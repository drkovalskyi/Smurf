Since the EPS analysis was completed, we identified the following small technical
changes required to make the analysis more consistent:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The integrated luminosity estimate for EPS dataset is revised from 1.092 fb$^{-1}$ to 1.143 fb$^{-1}$.
    \item The \dytt and \dyll backgrounds are considered separately.
    \item The data to simulation scale factors for pile-up, lepton and trigger efficiencies are 
always applied to the simulation both when deriving and applying scale factors for background estimation.
    \item The residual jet energy corrections are included.
\end{itemize}

We additionally considered the effect on the analysis of adding FIXME describe MT cut here.
The effect of these changes is evaluated on the EPS dataset in Section \ref{sec:lp_technical_validation}.
