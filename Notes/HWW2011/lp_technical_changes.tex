The LP analysis makes the following additions or changes to the EPS analysis
described in the body of this document:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The integrated luminosity estimate for EPS dataset is revised from 1.092 fb$^{-1}$ to 1.143 fb$^{-1}$.
    \item The \dytt and \dyll backgrounds are considered separately.
    \item The data to simulation scale factors for pile-up, lepton and trigger efficiencies are 
always applied to the simulation both when deriving and applying scale factors for background estimation.
    \item The residual jet energy corrections are included.
\end{itemize}

The effect of these changes is evaluated on the EPS dataset in Section \ref{sec:lp_technical_validation}.

\subsubsection{Additional MT Preselection}

There is a concern that $W/\gamma*$ with $W\rightarrow \ell\nu$ 
and $\gamma*\rightarrow\ell\ell$ could be a significant unaccounted background.
This background, if present, could be reduced by a cut $M_T > 80$~GeV and $M_T< m^{Higgs}$
at the preselection level for the MVA analysis.

This cut was demonstrated to have a negligible effect on the expected signal yields. 
FIXME, put results here or refer to elsewhere.
Thus the cut can be considered a safe addition with potential benefits in reducing 
additional backgrounds that are poorly understood. 
As such, we present the results with and without this cut in Sections FIXME.
