The standard model (SM) of particle physics successfully describes
the majority of high-energy experimental data~\cite{pdg}. One of the key
remaining questions is the origin of the masses of $\W$~and $\Z$~bosons.
In the SM, it is attributed to the spontaneous breaking of electroweak
symmetry caused by a new scalar field~\cite{Higgs1, Higgs2, Higgs3}. The
existence of the associated field quantum,
the Higgs boson, has yet to be experimentally confirmed.
The $\WW$ channel is particularly sensitive for the Higgs boson
searches in the intermediate mass range (120 -- 200 $\GeVcc$).

This document describes the search of Higgs boson events with CMS  
at a center of mass energy of 7 TeV in the channel 
$\Hi\To\WW \To \Lep\Lprime\Nu\Nubar$, for Higgs boson masses in 
the range of 120-600 $\GeVcc$ using the 2011 data.

The main analysis strategy is to select events with two opposite charged leptons, 
large missing energy and little jet activity. The two leptons are required to be 
isolated electrons or muons, of moderate-high $\pt$ and with a small opening angle 
in the transverse plane. The 2010 $H \to \WW$ analysis~\cite{HWW2010} is the starting point, 
although several modifications and improvements have been added, partially to cope with 
the more difficult conditions due to the larger instantaneous luminosity regime, and 
partially to gain in sensitivity.

The note is structured as follows. A discussion about the data samples 
used in the analysis is presented in Section~\ref{sec:datasets}. Trigger 
selection, lepton selection, and other preselection requirements are described 
in detail in Section~\ref{sec:selection}. The final signal extraction is 
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:signal_selection}. A summary of the event data yields 
and the expectations from Monte Carlo is shown in Section~\ref{sec:yields}, followed 
by the estimation of the background in Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}. The signal
efficiency estimation, together with all sources of systematic 
uncertainties are explained in Section~\ref{sec:results}. Finally, the 
conclusions are included in Section~\ref{sec:summary}.
