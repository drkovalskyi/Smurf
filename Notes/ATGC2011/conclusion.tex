We presented a study of the anomalous triple gauge couplings in \wwll\
decays reconstructed from data collected in 2011 run at 7 TeV center
of mass energy. We searched for anomalous couplings by fitting the
leading lepton \pt\ distribution in a maximum-likelihood fit. The
results are consistent with the Standard Model.
