We have described the planned methodology for a search for $\Hi\to\WW$ decays in 
$pp$ collision 2011 data at $\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ with the CMS detector. We presented 
signal extraction and background estimation techniques along with their expected 
systematic uncertainties. We applied the methodology described to the currently 
available dataset containing $\intlumi$ of integrated luminosity collected during 
the 2011 run and showed the expected upper limits.
