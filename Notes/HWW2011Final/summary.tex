We have performed a search for the Higgs boson in $\Hi\to\WW$ decays
in $pp$ collision at $\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ with the CMS detector. The
analysis is based on a complete 2011 dataset corresponding to
$\intlumi$ of integrated luminosity. We see no evidence for the Higgs
boson and we exclude the Standard Model Higgs in [128,375]~\GeV{}
range and the fermiophobic Higgs in [150,190]~\GeV{} at 95\%C.L.
