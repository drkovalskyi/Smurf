To make maximal use of the event information we have performed a multivariate analysis 
using a multivariate classifier based on the Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) technique. 
The BDT is implemented using the TMVA~\cite{tmva} toolkit and has been 
successfully applied in high energy physics to increase the 
statistical significance of a signal extraction
It requires less training than other multivariate classifiers and 
it is insensitive to the inclusion of poorly discriminating input variables.

In addition to the $\WW$ preselection, we apply a loose cut on the
maximum $\mll$ to enhance the signal-to-background ratio shown in Table~\ref{tab:presel_tmva_analysis}. 
In addition to the selection variables for the cut-based analysis, the multivariate signal extraction 
procedure uses the following ones: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Delta R_{\Lep\Lep}\equiv\sqrt{\deletall^2 + \delphill^2}$ between the leptons, 
with $\deletall$ the $\eta$ difference between the leptons, 
which has similar properties as $\delphill$
\item lepton flavors ($\mu\mu$, $ee$, $e\mu$ or $\mu e$ );
\item finally, for the 1-jet bin, the azimutal angles between the dilepton 
system and $\met$, and between the dilepton system and the 
highest $\pt$ jet, are included.
\end{itemize}

The training has been carried out separately in the 0-jet and 1-jet bins 
for different Higgs masses using the corresponding signal samples. We use the same 
training as in~\cite{HWW2011} and the full shape of the classifier output is used 
as final discriminant variable.
