The shape analysis can be performed using any discriminating
variable. It was found in~\cite{MVASyst} that individual inputs used
for the BDT multivariate discriminator can give a comparable
sensitivity to the BDT based shape analysis. In particular it was
found that dilepton mass is a vary powerful discriminator for Higgs
mass of 140~\GeV\ and below. As a cross check to the main shape
analysis we performed a calculation of the Higgs exclusion limits
using the same event selection replacing the BDT output with dilepton
mass. Table~\ref{tab:altshape} shows the result of the
cross-check. Compared with the main result in
Table~\ref{tab:mvabase_uls} we see a fairly good agreement at the low
Higgs mass where we expect $m_{ll}$ and BDT results to be comparable.
