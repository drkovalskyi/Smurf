There are three processes which need to be estimated from Monte Carlo 
simulation, after applying the proper data corrections for lepton, trigger 
and jet veto efficiencies, in this low luminosity regime: $WZ$, 
$ZZ$, and $W+\gamma$.

$WZ$ and $ZZ$ events with lepton pairs from a resonant $Z$ boson are suppressed by the  
$Z$ veto. The remaining contribution is expected to be well modeled in the simulation
and thus the Monte Carlo prediction is used.

The $W+\gamma$ background, where the $\gamma$ fakes an electron through
an asymmetric conversion is difficult to estimate from data. Additional
cross-checks can be performed to place data based constraints on this estimate. 
For instance, applying the same standard selection, but requiring two same-sign 
leptons, gives a sample dominated by $\Wjets$ and $W+\gamma$ events. Again, the 
expected contribution is very small, due to stringent $\gamma$ conversion 
requirements explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:sel_electrons}.
