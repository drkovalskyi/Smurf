Primary vertices are reconstructed using the so-called Deterministic Annealing 
clustering of tracks~\cite{PVDA}. Reconstructed primary vertices are required to have a
$z$ position within 24~cm of the nominal detector center and a radial position within 
2~cm of the beamspot. There must also be greater than four degrees of freedom in
the fitted vertex. From the set of primary vertices in the event passing these
selection cuts, the vertex with the largest summed squared-$\pt$ of the associated
tracks is chosen as the event primary vertex. Reconstructed leptons will be required 
to have small impact parameters with respect to this vertex.
