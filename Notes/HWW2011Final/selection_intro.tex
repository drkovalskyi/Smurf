To enhance the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, two different approaches 
are performed. The first one is a cut-based approach where further requirements 
on a few observables are applied, while the second one makes use of
multivariate techniques. Both of them cover a large Higgs boson mass
($m_{\rm{H}}$) range, and each is separately optimized for different
$m_{\rm{H}}$ hypotheses. The first method is the simplest approach with smaller
systematic uncertainties. The second one is
more powerful, since it exploits the information present in the
correlation among the variables We use the discriminator
output distribution for the final signal extraction.

All analyses are further split in the corresponding 0-jet, 1-jet and
2-jet bins. In the 2-jet bin we use a simple cut-based approach for
now due to the limited sensitivity and the limited number of events in
simulation.
