We analyze the events separately based on the number of reconstructed 
jets with $\pt > ~30~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<5.0$ in the event. 
Jets are reconstructed using calorimeter and tracker information using a particle flow 
algorithm~\cite{jetpas}. The anti-${\rm k_T}$ clustering algorithm~\cite{antikt} 
with ${\rm R=0.5}$ is used. We apply the standard jet energy 
corrections~\cite{jes} to the reconstructed jets, where the L1 Fast Jets 
corrections are included. The latter corrections are rather important since 
they help in flatening the reconstruction efficiency as a function of the 
number of overlapping events.
To exclude electrons and muons from the jet sample, these 
jets are required to be separated from the selected leptons in $\Delta R$ 
by at least $\Delta R^{\mathrm{jet-lepton}}>0.3$.
