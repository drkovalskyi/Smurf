In summary, we described an analysis to study the spin of a single narrow 
resonance at 125 GeV by the gluon fusion through the decays into $\WW\to 2\ell2\nu$.  
The analysis is based on a two-dimensional templates $\mt-\mll$. The expected 
sensitivity to distinguish between between SM Higgs hypothesis and 
spin 2 Graviton like resonance with minimal coupling $2_\text{min}^+$ is 
about $2.4\sigma$ for the full 7+8 $\TeV$ dataset.
