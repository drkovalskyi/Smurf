In summary, we described an analysis to study the spin of a single narrow 
resonance at 125 GeV by the gluon fusion through the decays into $WW\to 2\ell2\nu$.  
The analysis is based on a two-dimensional templates $m_T-m_{\ell\ell}$. 
The expected sensitivity to distinguish between between SM Higgs hypothesis and 
spin 2 Graviton like resonance with minimal coupling 
$2_\text{min}^+$ is $1.3\sigma$ for \intlumiEightTeV. 
Scaling by luminosity the projected separation is about $1.7\sigma$ for 30~$\ifb$.
