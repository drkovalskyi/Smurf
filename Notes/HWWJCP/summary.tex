In summary, we described an analysis to study the spin of a single narrow 
resonance at 125 GeV by the gluon fusion through the decays into $WW\to 2\ell2\nu$.  
The analysis is based on a two-dimensional templates $m_T-m_{\ell\ell}$. 
We calculate the expected sensitivity to distinguish between 
between SM Higgs hypothesis and the spin 2 Graviton like analysis as 
$X\sigma$ for \intlumiEightTeV.
