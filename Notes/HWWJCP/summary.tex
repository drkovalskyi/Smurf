In summary, we described an analysis to study the spin of a single narrow 
resonance at 125 GeV by the gluon fusion through the decays into $\WW\to 2\ell2\nu$.  
The analysis is based on a two-dimensional templates $\mt-\mll$. 
The mean of the expected SM $0^+$ distribution is 1.9 standard deviations in the 
tail of the $2^+_{min}$ distribution, while the mean of the expected $2^+_{min}$ 
distribution is 2.4 standard deviations in the tail of the $0^+$ distribution. 
The observed separation consistencies are 0.9 and 1.3 standard deviations with 
respect to the $0^+$ and $2^+$ models, respectively.
