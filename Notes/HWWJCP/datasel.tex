The data and MC samples used in this analysis are the same 
as in the SM Higgs search analysis~\cite{HWWHCP2012}, with 
the exception of the signal samples. 

The $gg\to X\to WW$ signal samples are generated by JHUGen 
MC generator~\cite{jhugen} with the matrix elements 
calculated at the LO. The generated LHE files are then 
interfaced to PYTHIA for showering, hadronization, and underlying event.

To validate the JHUGen samples we compare the main kinematic distributions from JHUGen to 
MCFM at the generator level and to Powheg-Pythia at the reconstruction level. 
Figure~\ref{fig:jhuvsmcfm} compares the main kinematic observables at generator 
level between the JHUGen and MCFM for events without any cuts. 
Both samples are generated without any resonance boost. 
We have observed that the two matrix element calculations agree 
within a few percents.

Figure~\ref{fig:higgspt_0j} shows the Higgs $p_T$ and the leading jet 
$p_T$ distributions for the SM Higgs hypothesis comparing the 
JHUGen-Pythia and Powheg-Pythia~\cite{powheg} samples, after applying the full 
event selections. The two generators agree within 10\%. 
The differences are expected as the Powheg sample is generated with the 
NLO calculations at the matrix element level. 
The effects on the main kinematic observables due to 
the difference in Higgs $p_T$ however are smaller, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:higgskin_0j}. 

To account for the differences seen in the SM Higgs samples, 
we reweight the SM Higgs templates in the final analysis 
to match to the predictions by Powheg-Pythia. 
The relative differences observed in the SM Higgs resonance are 
applied to the other signal hypothesis. 
The main reason is that for all signal hypotheses, the resonances 
are assumed to be a colorless object. Therefore the missing higher 
order effects are similar between different hypotheses. 
Figure~\ref{fig:gravvshiggspt_0j} shows the resonance $p_T$ and 
the leading jet $p_T$ distributions comparing the spin 2 
graviton and the SM Higgs hypothesis generated with the JHUGen-Pythia. 
The two hypotheses agree within a few \% in the bulk of the distributions, 
smaller than the differences between Powheg-Pythia and JHUGen-Pythia 
in the SM Higgs hypothesis. 
Additional shape systematics due to this difference is then added as well, see section~\ref{sec:systematics}.
