In this section we document the expected separatoins between 
the SM Higgs and spin 2 graviton hypothesis calculated for \intlumiEightTeV 
at 8 TeV.  
Figure~\ref{fig:exp12fb} shows the distributions of 
$q=-2\text{ln}({\cal L}_{2_\text{min}^+}/{\cal L}_{\text{0}^+})$
with generated samples of background and signal of two types, 
SM $0^+$ and minimal couplings spin 2 $2_\text{min}^+$, for $m_H=$125 GeV. 
Here the likelihoods, $\cal L$, are calculated with the signal rates 
allowed to float indepdently for each signal type and the nusiance 
parameters are treated as independent. 
The expected distributions are generated with the same number of events 
after the full event selections. 
The mean of the expected SM $0^+$ distribution is 1.1 standard deviations 
in the tail of the $2_\text{min}^+$ distribution, while 
the mean of the expected $2_\text{min}^+$ distribution is 1.0 standard deviations 
in the tail of the $0^+$ distribution.
