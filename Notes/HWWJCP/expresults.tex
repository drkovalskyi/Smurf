%In this section we document the expected separation between 
%the SM Higgs and $2_\text{min}^+$ graviton hypotheses for \intlumiEightTeV at 8 TeV.  

As in the SM Higgs search, we use two-dimensional templates 
$m_T-m_{\ell\ell}$ to distinguish between the SM Higgs and 
$2_\text{min}^+$ graviton hypotheses. 
For each hypothesis we build a maximum likelihood ($\cal L$) fit to extract 
the signal strength and background contributions simultaneously, 
in the same way as in the SM Higgs search. 
The two models, ${\cal L}_{2_\text{min}^+}$ for the $2_\text{min}^+$ graviton 
and ${\cal L}_{0^+}$ for SM Higgs, differ only in the signal model and its systematics. 
For a given dataset we perform the maximum likelihood fits for both models.  
Here the likelihoods, $\cal L$, are calculated with the signal rates 
allowed to float indepdently for each signal type and the nusiance 
parameters are treated as independent. 
The difference in the best fit likelihoods, 
$q=-2\text{ln}({\cal L}_{2_\text{min}^+}/{\cal L}_{\text{0}^+})$, 
is then used to quantify the consistency of data to the two models. 

Figure~\ref{fig:expsep} shows the distributions of 
$q=-2\text{ln}({\cal L}_{2_\text{min}^+}/{\cal L}_{\text{0}^+})$
with generated samples of background and signal of the SM Higgs and 
$2_\text{min}^+$ Graviton at 125 GeV. 
%SM $0^+$ and minimal couplings spin 2 $2_\text{min}^+$, for $m_H=$125 GeV. 
The expected distributions are generated with the same number of events 
after the full event selections. 
The mean of the expected SM $0^+$ distribution is 1.5 standard deviations 
in the tail of the $2_\text{min}^+$ distribution, while 
the mean of the expected $2_\text{min}^+$ distribution is 1.2 standard deviations 
in the tail of the $0^+$ distribution. 
The average separation between the two hypothesis is about $1.3\sigma$. 
The signal to background significance expected on average 
for the SM Higgs hypothesis is $3.3\sigma$, while for the spin 2 graviton $2_\text{min}^+$ 
model it is around $2.6\sigma$. 
%Scaling purely by luminosity, 
The expected average separation between the SM Higgs and $2_\text{min}^+$ 
hypotheses is about $1.7\sigma$ for 30~$\ifb$ scaling purely by luminosity.
