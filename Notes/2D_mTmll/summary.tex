A 2-dimensional shape analysis searching for the Higgs boson 
in the $W^+W^- \to 2\ell2\nu$ final state is described.
The study is done with events in $e\mu$ final states containing
0 or 1 reconstructed jets. In \intlumiEightTeV~we expected 20 \% 
better significance at \mHi = 125 \GeV~compared to the BDT shape analysis. 
In 20~\ifb~we expect Higgs boson signal at \mHi = 125 \GeV~with 4$\sigma$ 
significance.
