We have presented a 2-dimensional shape analysis 
for the Higgs boson decay channel $W^+W^- \to 2\ell2\nu$.
We have Applied this analysis on the expected signal and backgrounds
in the most sensitive channels with different flavor leptons.
In a dataset corresponding to \intlumiEightTeV,
we can expect to achieve a 25\% signal significance improvement
compared to the BDT shape analysis
for a Higgs boson mass of 125 \GeV.
