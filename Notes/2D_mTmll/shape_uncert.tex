For the shape variation, we use the same technique used by BDT shape analysis \cite{MVASyst}.
\textcolor{red}{Alternative shapes for lepton \pt and MET resolutions, and lepton efficiency 
are not implemented yet. Only is normalization included for now. Effect of missing these 
alternative shapes to the expected significance is smaller than 10 \%. These will be added 
in a near future.}
