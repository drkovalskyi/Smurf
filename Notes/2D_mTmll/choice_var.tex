Table~\ref{tab:bdt_correlations} shows the correlations between BDT discriminator and
kinimatic variables for signal(\mHi=125~\GeV) and background events. \mll is the most 
correlated variable for both signal and background.

	\caption{ The correlations of \mll with event kinematic variables in simulated events.  
 		 	  Rows are sorted by highest correlation in signal events. }
	\label{tab:mll_correlations}
\end{table} 

Table~\ref{tab:mll_correlations} shows correlations between \mll~and other kinematic variables
for signal(\mHi=125~\GeV) and background events. \delphill, \ptlmax, and \ptlmin~are strongly 
correlated with \mll~while \met~and \mt~are not.

Therefore, we choose \mll~because it is the most correlated variable with BDT discriminator.
The second variable is \mt~because it is second most correlated with BDT discriminator 
excluding variables strongly correlated with \mll.
