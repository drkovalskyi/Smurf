To compare the performance of the BDT shape analysis and the 2D method,
we calculate expected significance using the standard Combination tool \cite{combine}. 
The comparison is performed for the the 0 and 1-jet categories, as well
as their combination with the VBF category. 
In all cases only the different lepton flavor
final state is considered.
