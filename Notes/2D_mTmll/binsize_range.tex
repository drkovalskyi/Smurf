We choose bin sizes based on the resolution of signal events. 
The resolutions of $M_{ll}$ and $M_T$ distributions are 20-25~\GeV.    
In principle, finner bins would result in better sensitivity
as long as there are enough statistics in each bin.
Since this is not the case for this study because of limited number of events
in the simulated samples, we stick to the choice based on the resoultions. 
In appendix~\ref{app:binsize} it is shown that finer bining does not change S/B much. 

The range of variables is chosen to cover the Higgs mass up to 200 \GeV.
So, the range of \mt~is from 80 to 280 \GeV~and that of \mll~is 0 to 200 \GeV.
