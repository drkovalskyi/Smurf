We make 2D templates applying cuts that increase S/B. 
On top of WW preselection \cite{HWW2012ICHEP}, cuts for BDT shape analysis are applied 
except for the following differences. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \mt~is relaxed up to 280 \GeV
	\item \mll~is relaxed up to 200 \GeV  
	\item \ptlmax~and \ptlmin~cuts for cut-based analysis are applied    
\end{itemize}

The choice of upper bound of \mt~and \mll~is described in the subsection \ref{sec:binsize_range}.
