We make 2D templates applying cuts that increase S/B. 
On top of WW preselection \cite{HWW2012ICHEP}, cuts for BDT shape analysis are applied 
except for the following differences. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \mt~is relaxed up to 280 \GeV
	\item \mll~is relaxed up to 200 \GeV  
\end{itemize}

The choice of upper bound of \mt~and \mll~is described in the subsection \ref{sec:binsize_range}. 
The chosen ranges are for the low mass Higgs hypothese up to \mHi = 250 \GeV. For higher masses, 
ranges should be expanded so that signal events are not cuf off.
