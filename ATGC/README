	nEvents - expected number of WW events
	PDF parameters:
	    Nbins = 18; - no need to have too many bins. You need to capture the shape, not to make it beautiful
	    minPt = 20;
	    maxPt = 200; - make sure it's not too big, i.e. that you have non-zero yield for all reference aTGC distributions

Data samples:
  UserCode/JRibnik/CMS2/NtupleMacros/WW/fit/samples - last year Sherpa samples
  smurf - directory with smurf ntuples
